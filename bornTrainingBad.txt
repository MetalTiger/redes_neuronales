The mobile-telephone division of Telmex, Amￃﾩrica Mￃﾳvil, became a separate company in 2001 and enjoyed several years of spectacular growth, eventually becoming one of the largest telecommunications companies in the world
Amￃﾩrica Mￃﾳvil purchased its former parent in 2011
Slim acquired the ailing electronics products and services company CompUSA in 2000
After realizing that he had misjudged his ability to turn the company around￢ﾀﾔa rare misstep for Slim￢ﾀﾔhe sold it in 2007
In 2017 Amￃﾩrica Mￃﾳvil announced that it would launch a new Spanish-language television network, Nuestra Vision, aimed at a Mexican-American audience
In 2011 the museum moved to a larger building in the city
Slim was also prominent in the revitalization of the historic centre of Mexico City, establishing (2000) the Foundation for the Historic Centre of Mexico City, and he received the Hadrian Award from the World Monuments Fund in 2004 for his efforts in preserving culturally significant buildings in Mexico City
In 2009 the Carlos Slim Foundation partnered with Grameen Trust￢ﾀﾔa nonprofit venture of Grameen Bank , the Bangladeshi bank founded by economist Muhammad Yunus as a means of providing small loans to poor individuals￢ﾀﾔto launch the Grameen-Carso microcredit program in Mexico
Following an unexpected meeting between the two men in December 2016 (by which time Trump had become president-elect), Slim restated his view that investment and economic development in Mexico would prevent unwanted immigration much more effectively than a physical wall

Dopo aver percepito circa 2 miliardi di franchi dallo Stato (governo Fabius ) in cambio della promessa di non licenziare i 16000 dipendenti del gruppo, il 14 dicembre 1984 Bernard Arnault ha inviato una lettera a Laurent Fabius impegnandosi in questo modo: ￢ﾀﾜGarantirￃﾲ personalmente la direzione di DBSF e procederￃﾲ alla messa in opera della pianificazione industriale e sociale come comunicato alle amministrazioni￢ﾀﾝ
Queste diverse procedure non colpiscono Bernard Arnault [6] che da quel momento puￃﾲ concentrarsi sullo sviluppo di Christian Dior e sulle sue acquisizioni nel settore del lusso; diventa PDG di Christian Dior SA nel 1985, e nel 1989 riunisce i profumi alla couture all'interno della holding Christian Dior SA : questa holding ha come brand [7] Christian Dior Couture, e LVMH che possiede il marchio Parfums Christian Dior, in precedenza proprietￃﾠ di Moￃﾫt-Hennessy

Nel luglio 1988 Arnault acquisisce Cￃﾩline , nel 1993 LVMH acquisisce Berluti e Kenzo
Le acquisizioni si susseguono: nel 1994 Reneￃﾨ D

Il crac dei valori Internet a partire da marzo 2000 e ancor piￃﾹ gli attentati dell'11 settembre 2001 lo convincono ad accelerare la sua uscita da questo settore cedendo al gruppo Suez
L'8 dicembre 1999 viene inaugurata la torre LVMH in presenza di Hillary Clinton [16]
In associazione con Colony Capital, il gruppo Arnault entra nel capitale di Carrefour il 23 marzo 2007

Introducing the long-awaited novel from David Mitchell, available July 14, 2020
The Ming dynasty ( / m ￉ﾪ ￅﾋ / ), [7] officially the Great Ming , was an imperial dynasty of China , ruling from 1368 to 1644 following the collapse of the Mongol -led Yuan dynasty
Although the primary capital of Beijing fell in 1644 to a rebellion led by Li Zicheng (who established the short-lived Shun dynasty ), numerous rump regimes ruled by remnants of the Ming imperial family ￢ﾀﾔcollectively called the Southern Ming ￢ﾀﾔsurvived until 1662
Born in Baku, Soviet Union (now Azerbaijan) in 1963, he quickly developed at Mikhail Botvinnik &rsquo;s school, on his way to becoming the youngest champion in chess history in 1985
Always independent-minded, Kasparov split from FIDE in 1993, and would later become known outside of chess for his political activism after his 2005 retirement
Under coaches such as Vladimir Makogonov and Alexander Shakarov, he developed to the point of winning the Soviet Junior Championship in 1976 and 1977
The World Junior title came in 1980
A young Garry Kasparov in 1974
Although Kasparov did not earn a spot in the 1981 championship cycle to dethrone Anatoly Karpov -- the Interzonals occurred in 1979 -- he was ready for the &rsquo;84 cycle
Next he would face Viktor Korchnoi , Karpov&rsquo;s 1978 and 1981 challenger, in the semifinal
Kasparov entered the 1984 championship having played Karpov four times before, losing in 1975 (at 12 years old), and drawing three times in 1981
The format, as it had been for Karpov-Korchnoi matches in 1978 and &rsquo;81, was the first to six wins with draws not counting
Kasparov bore down to draw the next 17 games: not a strategy one could even try in a 24-game match, but an effective one in the 1984 format
(Source: The World Chess Championship Karpov Kasparov Moscow 1985 , Raduga Publishers 1986
It is, of course, unknown how the 1984 match might have ended
He was 22 years and seven months old, 11 months younger than Mikhail Tal had been in 1960
Kasparov had now faced Karpov 72 times in the past 15 months, from September 1984 to November 1985
Karpov automatically got a rematch with Kasparov in 1986 thanks to the circumstances of 1984-85
The world championship process somewhat reset in 1987 as the Interzonal and Candidates tournaments returned on their original schedule
Kasparov, left, and Karpov (as well as Jan Timman over Karpov's shoulder) in 1987
The 1987 World Championship was arguably the most dramatic of the Kasparov-Karpov matches
Nigel Short defeated Karpov in the semifinals of the 1993 Candidates tournament, then defeated Jan Timman to earn a match with Kasparov
Kasparov defeated this split title once, in a match with Viswanathan Anand in 1995
Less famously than the match a year later, he played Deep Blue in 1996
Then came the 1997 match , which Kasparov dropped in dramatic fashion, after which IBM retired Deep Blue
As for then-nascent internet chess, Kasparov defeated &ldquo;The World&rdquo; in a game held by online vote in 1999
Then there was the matter of the 1999 tournament at Wijk aan Zee
Although it was the first time he had won this particular event, he would also win it in 2000 and 2001
But more notably, the 1999 Wijk tournament featured the game that rivaled Game 16 in 1985 for the best of his career and perhaps all time: a double rook sacrifice and a king hunt against Bulgaria&rsquo;s Veselin Topalov
With Kasparov still a FIDE outsider, a championship match was organized between him and Vladimir Kramnik in 2000
&copy; 2022 David Mitchell
He served as the General Secretary of the Communist Party of China from 2002 to 2012, Chairman of the CPC Central Military Commission from 2004 to 2012 and President of the People's Republic of China from 2003 to 2013
Kasparov&rsquo;s career came to an end at the Linares tournament in 2005
(No one else won it more than three times until it was abandoned in 2010
Karpov&rsquo;s bid failed, and in 2014 Kasparov himself ran for the position, but was also defeated
Ilyumzhinov finally left the presidency of FIDE in 2018
Louis Rapid and Blitz in 2017, his first non-exhibition chess since 2005
Emanuel Lasker had a longer championship run and Bobby Fischer probably had a higher peak with his 6-0 wins over Mark Taimanov and Bent Larsen in the 1972 Candidates, but neither Lasker nor Fischer can match Kasparov&rsquo;s combination of longevity and dominance
His 1985 gambit against Karpov eventually proved refutable, but in that moment and several others, Kasparov&rsquo;s willingness to try things led to brilliant victories

Year 1985 saw the appointed of him as the provincial Committee Secretary of Communist Party of China
The forced resignation of Hu Yaobang in 1987 led to his appointment as the Party Regional Committee Secretary of the Tibetan Autonomous Region in 1988
The years 1988 and 1989 were marked as a period of unrest and ethnic conflict in Tibet as anti-Han Chinese sentiments brewed amongst local well-placed Tibetans
He finally declared martial law in 1989 in order to curb the revolution
In 1639 the new Tokugawa regime of Japan shut down most of its foreign trade with European powers, cutting off another source of silver coming into China

For 2005￢ﾀﾓ2006 (as reported in the 2008 Almanac of American Politics ), McCain's average ratings were as follows: economic policy: 59percent conservative and 41percent liberal; social policy: 54percent conservative and 38percent liberal; and foreign policy: 56percent conservative and 43percent liberal
[438] During Barack Obama's presidency, McCain was one of the top five Republicans most likely to vote with Obama's position on significant votes; McCain voted with Obama's position on such votes more than half the time in 2013 and was "censured by the Arizona Republican party for a so-called 'liberal' voting record"
From the late 1990s until 2008, McCain was a board member of Project Vote Smart which was set up by Richard Kimball , his 1986 Senate opponent
From 2008 through 2012, Timberlake focused on his acting career, effectively putting his music career on hiatus
Supported by the two top ten singles, " Filthy " and " Say Something " (featuring Chris Stapleton ), it concluded 2018 as the sixth best-selling album of the year
Lo stesso argomento in dettaglio: Campionato del mondo di scacchi 1984
In 1993 and 1994, he was a Mouseketeer on The All-New Mickey Mouse Club , where his castmates included future girlfriend and singer Britney Spears , future tourmate Christina Aguilera , future bandmate JC Chasez , and future movie actors Ryan Gosling and Keri Russell
A quel punto accadde l'imprevedibile: l'8 febbraio 1985 il presidente della FIDE , il filippino Florencio Campomanes , convocￃﾲ una conferenza stampa in cui comunicￃﾲ la fine del match, senza vincitori nￃﾩ vinti
Garri portava a sostegno della sua tesi il fatto che da diverse partite ormai era lui ad avere l'iniziativa del gioco, trovando in Karpov sempre meno resistenza dovuta all'estrema stanchezza; il campione del resto aveva giￃﾠ dato dimostrazione di sopportare molto male la fatica di uno sforzo prolungato nel match del 1978 contro Korￄﾍnoj, in cui in vantaggio 5-2 subￃﾬ la rimonta dello sfidante vincendo poi alla 32ￂﾪ grazie solo ad un errore dell'avversario
Il 3 settembre 1985 i due rivali si ritrovarono di fronte alla scacchiera a Mosca , stavolta con regole molto piￃﾹ restrittive
Con il pareggio il campione conserva il titolo, a Karpov inoltre venne concesso il diritto di chiedere la rivincita in caso di perdita del titolo come compensazione della perdita del vantaggio del match del 1984
Come da accordi presi in seguito all'interruzione del match del 1984, l'ex campione chiese di disputare una rivincita e la FIDE organizzￃﾲ pertanto il terzo match in tre anni tra i due giocatori che iniziￃﾲ il 28 luglio 1986 a Londra e si concluse l'8 ottobre, dello stesso anno, a Leningrado
Prese parte a novembre anche all' Olimpiade di Dubai 1986 come capitano della squadra sovietica, dominando la competizione: vinse sia l'oro a squadre che quello individuale come prima scacchiera, vinse inoltre anche un altro oro per la miglior performance Elo del torneo
Nel 1987 Kasparov vinse a pari merito il torneo di Bruxelles con 8,5/11
Successivamente si preparￃﾲ nuovamente per difendere nuovamente il suo titolo mondiale, stavolta si trattava di una edizione programmata, essendo trascorso il ciclo triennale del campionato mondiale del 1984, a differenza delle edizioni 1985 e 1986 che furono competizioni straordinarie
Nell' Olimpiade di Salonicco 1988 Kasparov riuscￃﾬ a ripetere il trionfo di due anni prima, conquistando tutti i tre ori a cui poteva aspirare (oro a squadre, individuale in prima scacchiera con 8,5/10 e performance Elo)
Nel quadriennio 1985-1988 vinse quattro volte su quattro l' oscar degli scacchi , portando il suo totale a 6, prima dell'interruzione del trofeo che durerￃﾠ fino al 1994
Nel 1990 Kasparov vinse per la prima volta il Torneo di Linares e si preparￃﾲ a difendere nuovamente il suo titolo mondiale
Il suo eterno avversario Karpov dimostrￃﾲ ancora una volta il proprio vigore e la propria forza affrontando alla pari con gli altri contendenti al titolo il torneo dei candidati (nel 1987 era stato favorito in quanto ex-campione del mondo, qualificandosi direttamente alla finale), vincendolo
Tra il 1991 e il 1993 Kasparov dominￃﾲ quasi incontrastato la scena mondiale degli scacchi, complice anche un calo di rendimento del grande rivale Karpov, vincendo numerosi tornei (Tilburg 1991, Linares 1992 e 1993, Dortmund 1992 per citare i piￃﾹ importanti)
Alle Olimpiadi di Manila del 1992 non riuscￃﾬ a ripetere la tripletta delle edizioni 1986 e 1988: vinse infatti l'oro a squadre e quello individuale in prima scacchiera ma fu superato dal giovane Vladimir Kramnik nella competizione relativa alla performance Elo, dovendosi accontentare dell'argento
Nel 1993 il campione era chiamato a difendere il proprio titolo

In his 2008 speech to the CPAC McCain stated that he believed in "small government; fiscal discipline; low taxes; a strong defense, judges who enforce, and not make, our laws; the social values that are the true source of our strength; and, generally, the steadfast defense of our rights to life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness, which I have defended my entire career as God-given to the born and unborn
In his 2018 memoir The Restless Wave , McCain described his views as such: "Last but not least, I was [at the time of entering Congress] a Republican, a Reagan Republican
McCain and his wife Cindy watch in 2011 as their son Jimmy pins aviator wings on their son Ensign John Sidney McCain IV
[65] [452] [456] [459] McCain's shift of political stances and attitudes during and especially after the 2008 presidential campaign, including his self-repudiation of the maverick label, left many writers expressing sadness and wondering what had happened to the McCain they thought they had known
[465] His other traits included a penchant for lucky charms, [466] a fondness for hiking, [467] and a sense of humor that sometimes backfired spectacularly, as when he made a joke in 1998 about the Clintons that was widely deemed not fit to print in newspapers: "Do you know why Chelsea Clinton is so ugly
Kevin McCarthy also said in December that there would be payback for Democrats if Republicans get control of the House again in the 2022 midterms
Va segnalato che l'astio tra Kasparov e Campomanes risaliva giￃﾠ al 1985 , quando il giovane Garri accusￃﾲ il presidente di averlo volontariamente danneggiato sospendendo il match valido per il campionato mondiale; due anni dopo Kasparov creￃﾲ e divenne presidente della Grandmasters Association (GMA), una sorta di sindacato dei giocatori professionisti di scacchi che aveva come fine quello di aumentare il peso del volere dei giocatori nell'organizzazione dello scacchismo mondiale
A gettare benzina sul fuoco vi era il fatto che dopo il pareggio del mondiale 1987 Campomanes appoggiￃﾲ le osservazioni di chi riteneva che fosse ora di iniziare a valutare l'introduzione di un sistema di spareggio ed abolire il secolare privilegio (risalente agli albori del campionato del mondo) che permetteva al campione di conservare il titolo in caso di paritￃﾠ
Alle olimpiadi del 1994 la sua prestazione fu decisamente piￃﾹ deludente, mancando per la prima volta una medaglia individuale, vincendo unicamente l'oro a squadre con la nazionale russa
Alle olimpiadi di Erevan nel 1996 mancￃﾲ la tripletta di ori per un soffio, vincendo oro a squadre e performance Elo, ma arrivando secondo nella competizione individuale come prima scacchiera dietro Mohamad Al-Modiahki
Nel 1996 e nel 1997 Kasparov giocￃﾲ una coppia di sfide contro il supercomputer IBM Deep Blue
La prima sfida si disputￃﾲ a Filadelfia a partire dal 10 febbraio 1996
Nella seconda metￃﾠ del decennio Kasparov continuￃﾲ a confermarsi il giocatore piￃﾹ forte del mondo, vincendo tornei di altissimo livello ( Las Palmas 1996 , Linares 1997, 1999 e 2000, Novgorod 1997, Tilburg 1997, Sarajevo 1999 e 2000, Wijk aan Zee 1999 e 2000)
Venne inoltre premiato come miglior giocatore del mondo nel 1996 e 1999
Kasparov tentￃﾲ di organizzare un match per il titolo mondiale prima contro Anand e poi contro Aleksej ￅﾠirov , tentￃﾲ anche di negoziare la riunificazione del titolo mondiale con il nuovo presidente della FIDE Kirsan Iljumￅﾾinov (succeduto all'odiato Campomanes nel 1995): Dopo queste alterne vicende nel 2000 Kasparov riuscￃﾬ finalmente a trovare l'appoggio di Braingames che sponsorizzￃﾲ l'evento

From 2017 until 2021, Roberts served as Fox News' Chief White House Correspondent, covering Donald Trump 's administration

The film premiered at the 2001 Berlin International Film Festival
[91] Roger Ebert praised his departure from dark and troubled characters, [89] while two Entertainment Weekly critics in 2018 called it DiCaprio's best role, labeling him "delightfully persuasive, deceptive, flirtatious, and sometimes tragic￢ﾀﾔand we dare you to find a better role, if you can"
" [99] DiCaprio's first producing task was in The Assassination of Richard Nixon , starring Sean Penn as Samuel Byck , [100] which was screened in the Un Certain Regard section at the 2004 Cannes Film Festival

Al-Qaeda continued to release time-sensitive and professionally verified videos demonstrating bin Laden's continued survival, including in August 2007
In the first week of December 2009, a Taliban detainee in Pakistan said he had information that bin Laden was in Afghanistan in 2009
In a 2010 letter, bin Laden chastised followers who had reinterpreted al-tatarrus ￢ﾀﾔan Islamic doctrine meant to excuse the unintended killing of non-combatants in unusual circumstances￢ﾀﾔto justify routine massacres of Muslim civilians, which had turned Muslims against the extremist movement

1950 zog die Familie nach Little Italy , wo Scorsese erstmals mit der Kirche in Berￃﾼhrung kam und sich entschloss, Priester zu werden
[2] Nach dem Ausschluss aus der Jesuitenschule strebte er eine Ausbildung als Lehrer an, entschied sich an der New York University 1960 aber fￃﾼr die Filmkunst
Mit finanzieller Unterstￃﾼtzung seines Dozenten drehte Scorsese erste preisgekrￃﾶnte Kurzfilme und schloss 1965 sein Bachelor -Studium ab
Im Herbst 1971 drehte er fￃﾼr Roger Corman seinen ersten Hollywood -Film, Die Faust der Rebellen , der trotz durchwachsener Kritiken sein Publikum fand
Nachdem man ihn in die Gewerkschaft der Regisseure aufgenommen hatte, drehte Scorsese mit Hexenkessel 1973 seinen ersten kommerziell erfolgreichen Autorenfilm , der ihn und seinen Darsteller Robert De Niro schlagartig bekannt machte
Seine Idee, das groￃﾟe Hollywood - Musical mit Liza Minnelli und Robert De Niro in dem 1977 verￃﾶffentlichten New York, New York wiederzubeleben, fiel nach zweijￃﾤhriger Produktion bei Kritik und Publikum durch
Minnelli besetzte Scorsese im selben Jahr als Theaterregisseur in seinem Broadway -Debￃﾼt mit dem Musical The Act , das es von Oktober 1977 bis Juli 1978 auf ￃﾼber zweihundert Auffￃﾼhrungen brachte und seiner Hauptdarstellerin den Tony Award bescherte
Obwohl der 1980 entstandene Boxerfilm Wie ein wilder Stier als Meisterwerk gehandelt wurde, hielt sich Scorseses Ruf als Kassengift , der auch die boshafte Komￃﾶdie King of Comedy (1983) an den Kinokassen floppen lieￃﾟ
Wegen massiver Proteste religiￃﾶser Gruppierungen wurden die Dreharbeiten zur lange vorbereiteten Jesus -Verfilmung Die letzte Versuchung Christi 1983 zunￃﾤchst abgesagt
In Cannes wurde Scorsese 1986 als bester Regisseur fￃﾼr Die Zeit nach Mitternacht ausgezeichnet und zurￃﾼck ins Rampenlicht gerￃﾼckt
1995 beschloss er mit Casino seine Mafia -Trilogie, die er mit Hexenkessel und Good Fellas ￢ﾀﾓ Drei Jahrzehnte in der Mafia (1990) begonnen hatte
Erst 26 Jahre nach seiner ersten Nominierung fￃﾼr Wie ein wilder Stier gewann er 2007 den Academy Award fￃﾼr Departed ￢ﾀﾓ Unter Feinden , eine US-amerikanische Neuverfilmung des Hongkong-Films Infernal Affairs
2004 lieh er in dem Animationsfilm Groￃﾟe Haie ￢ﾀﾓ Kleine Fische einer nach seiner Person gezeichneten Figur seine Stimme
Martin Scorsese ist seit 1999 mit der Filmproduzentin Helen Morris verheiratet
Auￃﾟerdem war er von 1989 bis 1997 mit der Schauspielerin Illeana Douglas liiert, die er in mehreren seiner Filme besetzte
Seine 1976 und 1999 geborenen Tￃﾶchter Domenica Cameron-Scorsese (aus der Ehe mit der Drehbuchautorin und Regisseurin Julia Cameron) und Francesca Scorsese (aus der Ehe mit Morris) betraute er in einigen Filmen mit kleineren Rollen
2003 wurde Scorsese mit einem Stern auf dem Hollywood Walk of Fame (6801 Hollywood Boulevard) geehrt
Bei der Verleihung der Golden Globe Awards 2010 wurde Scorsese durch Leonardo DiCaprio und Robert De Niro fￃﾼr sein Lebenswerk mit dem Cecil B

Martin, Moosach , in Munich in 1951
In his 1968 book Introduction to Christianity , he wrote that the pope has a duty to hear differing voices within the Church before making a decision, and he downplayed the centrality of the papacy
During this time, he distanced himself from the atmosphere of Tￃﾼbingen and the Marxist leanings of the student movement of the 1960s that quickly radicalised, in the years 1967 and 1968, culminating in a series of disturbances and riots in April and May 1968
Some voices, among them Kￃﾼng, deem this a turn towards conservatism, while Ratzinger himself said in a 1993 interview, "I see no break in my views as a theologian [over the years]"
Later, as the Prefect of the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith , Ratzinger most clearly spelled out the Catholic Church's position on other religions in the 2000 document Dominus Iesus which also talks about the Catholic way to engage in " ecumenical dialogue"
In 1969, he returned to Bavaria, to the University of Regensburg and co-founded the theological journal Communio , with Hans Urs von Balthasar , Henri de Lubac , Walter Kasper and others, in 1972
[41] [42] He served as Vice President of the University of Regensburg from 1976 to 1977

Seine Eltern waren ￃﾁngel Castro Argiz , aus der galicischen Stadt Lugo ursprￃﾼnglich als Kolonialsoldat nach Kuba entsandter und spￃﾤter eingewanderter Spanier , und die Hausangestellte Lina Ruz Gonzￃﾡlez aus einer mittellosen Bauernfamilie aus der Provinz Pinar del Rￃﾭo , die ￃﾁngel nach der Scheidung von seiner ersten Frau 1941 geheiratet hatte
Er absolvierte die Schulzeit zunￃﾤchst im Heimatort Birￃﾡn und besuchte anschlieￃﾟend eine auf Initiative Fulgencio Batistas gegrￃﾼndete, kombinierte zivil-militￃﾤrische Landschule sowie ab 1938 das Jesuitenkolleg Colegio Dolores in Santiago de Cuba , das auch seine Brￃﾼder Fidel und Ramￃﾳn besuchten
1945 ging er mit Unterstￃﾼtzung seines Vaters in das Jesuitenkolleg Colegio Belￃﾩn nach Havanna , das bereits sein Bruder Fidel besuchte
[3] 1946 musste Raￃﾺl das Kolleg verlassen und arbeitete danach wieder in der Landwirtschaft in Birￃﾡn
[4] 1950 kehrte Raￃﾺl nach Havanna zurￃﾼck, wo er bei seinem Bruder Fidel in eine Dachgeschosswohnung einzog
Wￃﾤhrend seiner Studienzeit engagierte sich Raￃﾺl in der Juventud Socialista (￢ﾀﾞSozialistische Jugend￢ﾀﾜ), dem Jugendverband der der Sowjetunion nahestehenden Kommunistischen Partei Kubas (die 1944 bis 1962 den Namen Partido Socialista Popular (PSP) trug)
So nahm er im Mￃﾤrz 1953 an der vom kommunistischen Weltbund der Demokratischen Jugend organisierten Internationalen Konferenz zur Verteidigung der Jugendrechte in Wien als Delegierter teil, wo der sowjetische Auslandsnachrichtendienst auf ihn aufmerksam wurde, und besuchte anschlieￃﾟend mehrere osteuropￃﾤische Lￃﾤnder, in denen nach dem Zweiten Weltkrieg unter dem Einfluss der von Josef Stalin gefￃﾼhrten Sowjetunion jeweils eine Kommunistische Partei die Regierung ￃﾼbernommen und die staatlichen Strukturen sowie das politische System umgebaut hatte
Juni 1953 nach Kuba wurde Castro zunￃﾤchst von der Polizei festgenommen ￢ﾀﾓ er hatte kommunistisches Propagandamaterial bei sich gefￃﾼhrt und gegen die Festnahme zweier mittelamerikanischer Mitreisender protestiert
Nach seiner Freilassung wurde er im Juni 1953 von der Sozialistischen Jugend als Vollmitglied aufgenommen

Nach dem Sieg der Revolution heiratete Raￃﾺl im Januar 1959 in Santiago de Cuba Vilma Espￃﾭn , die ihm bereits wￃﾤhrend des mexikanischen Exils als aktive Unterstￃﾼtzerin der revolutionￃﾤren Bewegung begegnet war und die letzten Monate des Guerillakriegs an seiner Seite verbracht hatte

Juni 1955 nach Mexiko ins Exil
Raￃﾺl machte im Juli 1956 sowohl Guevara als auch Fidel mit seinem inzwischen in der sowjetischen Botschaft in Mexiko tￃﾤtigen russischen Freund Leonow bekannt, der 1958 zum KGB wechselte
Wￃﾤhrend des Kampfes in der Sierra Maestra wie schon wￃﾤhrend der chaotischen Anfangszeit ab Dezember 1956 galt Raￃﾺl Castro als disziplinierter und harter Kￃﾤmpfer
[14] Ende Februar 1958 wurde er (gleichzeitig mit Juan Almeida ) in den Rang des Comandante erhoben und mit der Grￃﾼndung und Leitung der Zweiten Front beauftragt, die nach Frank Paￃﾭs , dem populￃﾤren Organisator des stￃﾤdtischen Untergrundkampfes, benannt wurde, der im Sommer 1957 in Santiago getￃﾶtet worden war
Bei ￃﾜberfￃﾤllen auf die in US-Besitz befindlichen Nickelminen von Moa und Nicaro , ￃﾶstlich von Holguￃﾭn , sowie Betriebe der United Fruit Company lieￃﾟ Raￃﾺl Ende Juni 1958 mehrere Dutzend dort beschￃﾤftigte US-Amerikaner als Geiseln nehmen
During 2004, Federer won three Grand Slam singles titles and became the first person to do in one season so since Mats Wilander in 1988
[52] At the US Open , Federer defeated the 2001 champion, Lleyton Hewitt , for his first title there
His 11 singles titles were the most of any player in two decades, and his record of 74￢ﾀﾓ6 was the best since Ivan Lendl in 1986
Federer won 11 singles titles, which ties his 2004 season

The 2006 season was statistically the best season of Federer's career
com , ranked Federer's 2006 season as statistically the second-best season of all time during the Open Era, behind Rod Laver 's Grand Slam year of 1969
[61] Federer hits a forehand at the 2006 US Open, where he became the first man in history to achieve the Wimbledon-US Open double for three consecutive seasons
Federer won 12 singles titles (the most of any player since Thomas Muster in 1995 and John McEnroe in 1984) and had a match record of 92￢ﾀﾓ5 (the most wins since Ivan Lendl in 1982)
He was the first man to reach all four finals in a calendar year since Rod Laver in 1969
In the Australian Open , Federer defeated Marcos Baghdatis , [63] and at the US Open , Federer defeated 2003 champion Roddick
[63] Federer only lost to two players during 2006, to Nadal four times in finals, and to 19-year-old Andy Murray in the second round of the 2006 Cincinnati Masters , in what was Federer's only defeat before the final of a tournament that year
Near the end of the season he won his hometown tournament, the Swiss Indoors in Basel, Switzerland for the first time, having finished runner up in 2000 and 2001, and missing the tournament in 2004 and 2005 due to injuries
This made him the first man in the 21st century to accomplish the feat, as Bjￃﾶrn Borg at the 1980 French Open was the last to win a Grand Slam tournament without the loss of a set
[69] Federer was called "Darth Federer" by fans and commentators at the 2007 US Open
Once again, he defeated Rafael Nadal for a second consecutive year in the final, this time in a thrilling five-set encounter that many analysts hailed as the greatest Wimbledon final since 1980
Federer's success in 2008 was severely hampered by a lingering bout of mononucleosis , which he suffered during the first half of the year
The 2009 season was perhaps the most historically relevant of Federer's career as he completed a career Grand Slam by winning his first French Open title and won a men's record fifteenth Grand Slam singles title at Wimbledon, surpassing Pete Sampras's mark of fourteen

Im November 1956 vermutete Fidel einen Batista-Spitzel in den Reihen der Revolutionￃﾤre und ordnete ohne Verfahren dessen Erschieￃﾟung an
Unmittelbar nach dem Sieg der Revolution am Neujahrstag 1959 ￃﾼbernahm Raￃﾺl Castro die Moncada-Kaserne in Santiago de Cuba und damit das militￃﾤrische Kommando der Region
Nach der Kubanischen Revolution war Raￃﾺl Castro von 1959 bis 1976 Vize-Premierminister, danach wurde er Vizeprￃﾤsident des Staatsrates
Nach dem Sieg der Revolution 1959 betrieben sie die Annￃﾤherung an die Sowjetunion und den Ostblock jedoch gemeinsam
Auch die umfassende Landreform und Enteignung der Banken und Groￃﾟindustrie ab 1959 wurde von beiden einvernehmlich organisiert
[29] 1964 warf Raￃﾺl Che eine prochinesische Haltung vor
Wￃﾤhrend Che Guevara sich 1965 offen von der Sowjetunion abwandte und auch Fidel bei den Sowjets als unsicherer Gefￃﾤhrte galt, war Raￃﾺl stets ￢ﾀﾞihr Mann in Havanna￢ﾀﾜ
Raￃﾺl organisierte ab Januar 1959 die vￃﾶllige Umstrukturierung der bisherigen kubanischen Streitkrￃﾤfte und die Umwandlung der Revolutionstruppen, deren getrennt operierende Einheiten wￃﾤhrend des Guerillakrieges teilweise ein hohes Maￃﾟ an Autonomie hatten, in ein wirkungsvolles und zentral gelenktes Instrument des Staates
Oktober 1959 den Posten des Ministers der Revolutionￃﾤren Streitkrￃﾤfte an der Spitze des neu aufgebauten Ministeriums
Auf Bitte Raￃﾺl Castros unterstￃﾼtzte die Sowjetunion diesen Reorganisationsprozess ab April 1959 durch die vor der ￃﾖffentlichkeit geheim gehaltene Entsendung von zunￃﾤchst siebzehn spanischen Kommunisten, die an der sowjetischen Militￃﾤrakademie ausgebildet worden waren, als bezahlte Berater
Raￃﾺl Castro war 1959 daran beteiligt, den populￃﾤren, aber gegenￃﾼber kommunistischen Strￃﾶmungen sehr skeptischen Guerillafￃﾼhrer Comandante Huber Matos nach seiner Rￃﾼcktrittserklￃﾤrung wegen Hochverrats anklagen und in einem Prozess zu zwanzig Jahren Haft verurteilen zu lassen
Dessen Hinrichtung im Jahre 1989 wegen Korruption und Drogenhandels , obwohl Ochoa dies offensichtlich mit Wissen und Billigung der obersten Fￃﾼhrung tat, um Devisen fￃﾼr das Land zu beschaffen, war ein Signal, um politische Gegner auszuschalten und politisch ambitionierte Militￃﾤrs zu disziplinieren
So brachte er beispielsweise 1994 in der Zeit der tiefsten Krise, als es sogar zu Unruhen kam, seinen Bruder dazu, die erst 1986 abgeschafften freien Bauernmￃﾤrkte wieder zuzulassen, was zur raschen Verbesserung der Versorgungslage fￃﾼhrte
Juli 2006 ￃﾼbertrug der Staats- und Regierungschef Fidel Castro aufgrund einer schweren Erkrankung vorￃﾼbergehend die Fￃﾼhrung der Partei, den Oberbefehl ￃﾼber die Armee und das Amt des Staatsoberhaupts an seinen Stellvertreter und Bruder Raￃﾺl
[46] [47] Zahlreiche politische Gefangene , darunter alle der wￃﾤhrend des Schwarzen Frￃﾼhlings festgenommenen und zu langjￃﾤhrigen Haftstrafen verurteilten Mitglieder der ￢ﾀﾞGruppe der75￢ﾀﾜ, wurden bis Mￃﾤrz 2011 unter Vermittlung der katholischen Kirche freigelassen
Januar 2008 erreichte Raￃﾺl Castro mit 99,3 Prozent die hￃﾶchste Stimmenzahl aller Abgeordneten
Februar 2008 wurde Raￃﾺl vom Parlament zum Prￃﾤsidenten des Staatsrates (Staatsoberhaupt) und Prￃﾤsidenten des Ministerrates (Regierungschef) gewￃﾤhlt, nachdem sein Bruder Fidel einige Tage zuvor erklￃﾤrt hatte, nicht mehr fￃﾼr diese ￃﾄmter kandidieren zu wollen
Ab 2009 begann Raￃﾺl Castro sukzessive die oberste Fￃﾼhrungsriege im Ministerrat auszutauschen
Im Jahre 2010 kￃﾼndigte Raￃﾺl Castro Wirtschaftsreformen an
[42] Bis 2015 solle die Zahl auf 1,3 Millionen steigen
Parteitag der Kommunistischen Partei Kubas im April 2011 ￃﾼbernahm Castro auch das hￃﾶchste Parteiamt als Nachfolger seines Bruders
Dezember 2011 kￃﾼndigte Raￃﾺl Castro an, tausende Hￃﾤftlinge, darunter auch Dissidenten, aus ￢ﾀﾞhumanitￃﾤren Grￃﾼnden￢ﾀﾜ zu entlassen

His withdrawal from the French Open broke a record run of 65 consecutive participations in the main draw of Grand Slam tournaments, stretching back to the 2000 Australian Open
On 26 July, Federer announced that he would miss the 2016 Summer Olympics and the remainder of the 2016 season to fully recover from his knee injury
[190] The sudden withdrawal not only implied that 2016 was his first season since 2000 that Federer failed to win a title, but it also meant that he would have to drop out of top ten for the first time in fourteen years
Federer's 2017 season marked a return to Grand Slam wins since 2012, the most titles since 2007, and the highest win percentage since 2006

Jody Allen also remains the owner of the Portland Trail Blazers ￢ﾀﾔ which Paul Allen bought in 1988 ￢ﾀﾔ and Canzano wrote Tuesday that ￢ﾀﾜinsiders expect the Blazers to be positioned for auction in the next 6-18 months
Coach Pete Carroll and general manager John Schneider also mentioned Allen regularly in their news conference following the trade of Russell Wilson and then again during the draft, with Carroll at one point noting that Allen had told them they were ￢ﾀﾜback in your wheelhouse in having a multitude of draft picks and salary cap space over the next two years to build the team back to where it was when it won the Super Bowl in 2013
The Seahawks, though, have always been careful in their long-term spending, most years of the Schneider tenure since 2010 ranking near the bottom of the league in dead cap (meaning, money paid to players no longer on the roster)
The Seahawks currently have a total cap spending for the 2022 season of $229
Before Carolina, the last team to be sold was the Buffalo Bills in 2014 at $1
When Paul Allen bought the Seahawks in 1997 he paid $194 million

(Ra&uacute;l Modesto Castro Ruz; Bir&aacute;n, Holgu&iacute;n, 1931) Revolucionario, militar y pol&iacute;tico cubano, presidente de Cuba desde 2008 hasta 2018
Defensor a ultranza de la ortodoxia, su nombramiento como presidente cubano en 2008 no alent&oacute; expectativas de apertura, pero coincidi&oacute; con la llegada de Barack Obama a la Casa Blanca; tras un prolongado y discreto di&aacute;logo, ambos pa&iacute;ses restablecieron las relaciones diplom&aacute;ticas en 2015, si bien queda todav&iacute;a lejos el levantamiento del embargo econ&oacute;mico estadounidense, que, unido al fin de las ayudas sovi&eacute;ticas tras el derrumbe de la URSS en 1991, dej&oacute; en permanente penuria la econom&iacute;a de la isla
Su compromiso ideol&oacute;gico marxista era anterior al de su hermano Fidel: afiliado a la Juventud Socialista, organizaci&oacute;n del Partido Socialista Popular (PSP, de orientaci&oacute;n comunista), en febrero de 1953 particip&oacute;, en Viena, en el Congreso Mundial de la Juventud y visit&oacute; varias capitales del bloque sovi&eacute;tico
Ra&uacute;l, condenado por sedici&oacute;n a trece a&ntilde;os de c&aacute;rcel, fue liberado en mayo de 1955 gracias a una amnist&iacute;a general

Triunfante la insurrecci&oacute;n tras la huida de Batista y la entrada de los &laquo;barbudos&raquo; en La Habana (1 de enero de 1959), el ej&eacute;rcito rebelde se convirti&oacute; en las Fuerzas Armadas Revolucionarias (FAR), de las que fue nombrado jefe con categor&iacute;a de ministro el mismo d&iacute;a de su creaci&oacute;n, el 16 de octubre de 1959, y en cuya reorganizaci&oacute;n sigui&oacute; el modelo sovi&eacute;tico, seg&uacute;n los consejos de Leonov y luego de una visita a la Uni&oacute;n Sovi&eacute;tica en el verano de 1960
Su reputaci&oacute;n como jefe militar entr&oacute; en la leyenda del r&eacute;gimen despu&eacute;s de que asumiera el mando directo de las fuerzas que en abril de 1961 derrotaron a los exiliados cubanos en bah&iacute;a de Cochinos; el desembarco de los exiliados armados, auspiciado por Estados Unidos, ten&iacute;a como objetivo derrocar a Fidel
Ra&uacute;l Castro fue nombrado viceprimer ministro en 1962 y presidi&oacute; la delegaci&oacute;n cubana en las negociaciones con el Kremlin que desembocaron en el despliegue de misiles sovi&eacute;ticos en la isla, preludio de la m&aacute;s grave crisis sovi&eacute;tico-estadounidense durante la guerra fr&iacute;a: la &laquo;crisis de los misiles&raquo; (octubre de 1962)
En 1969 asisti&oacute; a un curso impartido por especialistas sovi&eacute;ticos, que siempre lo consideraron un aliado de confianza y un competente administrador
Fue reelegido para esos cargos en febrero de 1998 para un mandato de cinco a&ntilde;os

En la pugna con los responsables de la polic&iacute;a, Ra&uacute;l Castro acab&oacute; imponiendo los puntos de vista de las Fuerzas Armadas Revolucionarias cuando en diciembre de 1985 logr&oacute; la destituci&oacute;n de Ramiro Vald&eacute;s Men&eacute;ndez como ministro de Interior, eliminado tambi&eacute;n del bur&oacute; pol&iacute;tico en el tercer congreso del PCC (febrero de 1986)
Ra&uacute;l Castro se mostr&oacute; totalmente inflexible durante la que se considera la peor crisis del ej&eacute;rcito y quiz&aacute; del r&eacute;gimen, coincidente con los grandes cambios en la Uni&oacute;n Sovi&eacute;tica, que en julio de 1989 desemboc&oacute; en un simulacro de juicio sumar&iacute;simo y en la ejecuci&oacute;n del general Arnaldo Ochoa S&aacute;nchez, h&eacute;roe de las guerras de &Aacute;frica, acusado de corrupci&oacute;n y tr&aacute;fico de drogas
En un libro publicado en Cuba en 1997 ( Secretos de generales ), del periodista Luis B&aacute;ez, con pr&oacute;logo del ministro de las FAR, los cuarenta militares de m&aacute;s alta graduaci&oacute;n relataron sus experiencias dentro y fuera de Cuba y dejaron bien sentado que no abrigaban la menor tentaci&oacute;n pretoriana
Los primeros traslados a la Pen&iacute;nsula tuvieron lugar en julio de 2010
La medida formaba parte de un plan m&aacute;s amplio de reducci&oacute;n del sector estatal, consistente en la incorporaci&oacute;n de 1,8 millones de trabajadores cubanos al sistema econ&oacute;mico privado desde esa fecha hasta 2016
Ra&uacute;l Castro estuvo casado desde enero de 1959 con Vilma Esp&iacute;n Guillois (1930-2007), de una familia de la alta burgues&iacute;a, a la que hab&iacute;a conocido en febrero de 1957, durante la guerrilla en la Sierra Maestra
Vilma Esp&iacute;n fue presidenta de la Federaci&oacute;n de Mujeres Cubanas (FMC), miembro del comit&eacute; central del PC y del Consejo de Estado, y perteneci&oacute; al bur&oacute; pol&iacute;tico del PCC hasta 1991

Unsettled in Italy, Henry transferred from Juventus on 3 August 1999 to Arsenal for an estimated fee of ￂﾣ11million, reuniting with his former manager Arsￃﾨne Wenger
Coming off the back of a victorious UEFA Euro 2000 campaign with the national team, Henry was ready to make an impact in the 2000￢ﾀﾓ01 season

[2] [23] There was much expectation that Henry would replicate his club form for France during the 2002 FIFA World Cup , but the defending champions suffered a shock exit at the group stage
[26] [27] His rising status as one of the world's best footballers was affirmed when he emerged runner-up for the 2003 FIFA World Player of the Year award
[19] With 24 goals and 20 assists in the league, Henry set a new record for most assists in a single Premier League season, [28] and also became the first player in history to record at least 20 goals and 20 assists in a single season in one of Europe's top￢ﾀﾓfive leagues￢ﾀﾔthis feat has since been matched by Lionel Messi in 2020
[31] Apart from being named for the second year running as the PFA Players' Player of the Year and FWA Footballer of the Year , [26] [27] Henry emerged once again as the runner-up for 2004 FIFA World Player of the Year award
[2] [32] However, as was the case in 2002, Henry was unable to lead the national side to honours during UEFA Euro 2004
[32] The unexpected departure of Arsenal's captain Patrick Vieira in the 2005 close season led to Henry being awarded club captaincy, a role which many felt was not naturally suited for him; the captaincy is more commonly given to defenders or midfielders, who are better-placed on the pitch to read the game
[17] [18] [7] Between 1979 and 2009, he was the Lucasian Professor of Mathematics at the University of Cambridge

[126] Following a conference in Moscow in October 1981, Hawking and Gary Gibbons [7] organised a three-week Nuffield Workshop in the summer of 1982 on "The Very Early Universe" at Cambridge University, a workshop that focused mainly on inflation theory
In 1981 at a Vatican conference, he presented work suggesting that there might be no boundary or beginning or ending to the universe
Hawking subsequently developed the research in collaboration with Jim Hartle , [7] and in 1983 they published a model, known as the Hartle￢ﾀﾓHawking state
Further work by Hawking in the area of arrows of time led to the 1985 publication of a paper theorising that if the no-boundary proposition were correct, then when the universe stopped expanding and eventually collapsed, time would run backwards
[140] Honours continued to be awarded: in 1981 he was awarded the American Franklin Medal , [141] and in the 1982 New Year Honours appointed a Commander of the Order of the British Empire (CBE)
[142] [143] [144] These awards did not significantly change Hawking's financial status, and motivated by the need to finance his children's education and home-expenses, he decided in 1982 to write a popular book about the universe that would be accessible to the general public
[147] [148] A first draft of the book, called A Brief History of Time , was completed in 1984
[151] The book was published in April 1988 in the US and in June in the UK, and it proved to be an extraordinary success, rising quickly to the top of best-seller lists in both countries and remaining there for months
[162] In the 1989 Birthday Honours , he was appointed a Companion of Honour (CH)

Dungy began his head coaching tenure in 1996 with the Buccaneers, a franchise regarded as one of the league's worst
[187] In a 2004 lecture in Dublin, he conceded his 1997 bet with Preskill, but described his own, somewhat controversial solution to the information paradox problem, involving the possibility that black holes have more than one topology
He would be fired after the 2001 playoffs due to frequent postseason struggles, but is credited with constructing the team that won Super Bowl XXXVII the following year
[188] [172] In the 2005 paper he published on the subject, he argued that the information paradox was explained by examining all the alternative histories of universes, with the information loss in those with black holes being cancelled out by those without such loss
He retired from coaching following the 2008 season
[191] The particle was proposed to exist as part of the Higgs field theory by Peter Higgs in 1964
[2] Dungy was inducted to the Pro Football Hall of Fame in 2016

Google began in January 1996 as a research project by Larry Page and Sergey Brin when they were both PhD students at Stanford University in California
[22] [23] [24] The project initially involved an unofficial "third founder", Scott Hassan, the original lead programmer who wrote much of the code for the original Google Search engine, but he left before Google was officially founded as a company; [25] [26] Hassan went on to pursue a career in robotics and founded the company Willow Garage in 2006
Rajeev Motwani and Terry Winograd later co-authored with Page and Brin the first paper about the project, describing PageRank and the initial prototype of the Google search engine, published in 1998
com was registered on September 15, 1997, [41] and the company was incorporated on September 4, 1998
Google was initially funded by an August 1998 investment of $100,000 from Andy Bechtolsheim , [22] co-founder of Sun Microsystems , a few weeks prior to September 7, 1998, the day Google was officially incorporated
After some additional, small investments through the end of 1998 to early 1999, [46] a new $25 million round of funding was announced on June 7, 1999, [48] with major investors including the venture capital firms Kleiner Perkins and Sequoia Capital

After serving in the IDF, working for the Mossad, and practicing as a lawyer in her young adulthood, Livni entered the political arena in 1996 as a member of Likud
From 1996 to 2019, Livni served as a member of six consecutive Knessets
Knesset with the Herut and Likud parties from 1974 to 1984
Eitan and Sara￢ﾀﾙs marriage was the first official marriage ceremony in Israel after the state￢ﾀﾙs founding in May 1948
Livni worked for the Mossad from 1980 to 1984 before retiring from the agency and returning to Bar Ilan University to finish her law degree
Her time in the Mossad coincided with Operation Wrath of God, the Mossad￢ﾀﾙs retaliation for the 1971 Munich Massacre; while Livni has never confirmed that she was involved in the operation explicitly, there has been much speculation in Israeli society regarding whether or not she participated in missions related to this operation
She graduated from Bar Ilan University with an LLB in 1984 and spent the next decade working in commercial, public, and real estate law
In 1984, Livni married Naftali Spitzer, and they had two sons: Omri, born in 1987, and Yuval, born in 1990
Although she ranked too low on Likud￢ﾀﾙs list to become a member of the Knesset in the 1996 elections for the Fourteenth Knesset, Netanyahu appointed her in a special position as Director General of the Government Companies Authority
She held this position for three years, from 1996 to 1999
Livni became a member of the Knesset with Likud for the first time in the 1999 elections for the Fifteenth Knesset
The Fifteenth Knesset￢ﾀﾓwhich lasted from 1999 to 2003￢ﾀﾓencompassed a number of seismic convulsions in Israeli history, including the failure of the Camp David Summit in 2000, the beginning of the Second Intifada, Ehud Barak￢ﾀﾙs loss of the premiership to Ariel Sharon in 2001 in just the second special election for the office of the Prime Minister in Israel￢ﾀﾙs history, and Sharon￢ﾀﾙs subsequent convention of a national unity government
Livni remained a member of the Knesset with Likud following the 2003 elections for the Sixteenth Knesset, which ran from 2003 to 2006
Although Livni began her political career staunchly opposed to territorial concessions such as those outlined in the Oslo Accords in the mid-1990s, by 2005 she shifted to endorsing reasonable territorial concessions in the interest of keeping Israel a Jewish and democratic state
Livni joined Sharon in his new party, Kadima (￢ﾀﾜForward￢ﾀﾝ), in 2006
Kadima, now headed by Ehud Olmert, won the most seats in the 2006 elections and Livni continued as a member of the Knesset

Olmert resigned as Prime Minister in July 2008 following his indictment on corruption and bribery charges, triggering party elections for Kadima￢ﾀﾙs new leader
However, she was not able to form a working majority coalition (citing a refusal to capitulate to the Sephardic-Mizrahi Orthodox party, SHAS), which led to the elections for the Eighteenth Knesset in 2009
Erekat, at an Iftar hosted by United States￢ﾀﾙ Secretary of State John Kerry, 2013
From 2009 to 2012, Livni served as the Head of the Opposition in the Knesset
She resigned from the Eighteenth Knesset in March 2012 following her ouster as the head of Kadima, after an internal party split along more conservative and more liberal lines led to a redistribution of delegates that caused Livni to lose the popular support of the party
She was elected as a member of the Knesset with Hatunah in the 2013 elections for the Nineteenth Knesset, during which Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu appointed her as Minister of Justice and chief negotiator with the Palestinian Authority
Zionist Union failed to overtake Netanyahu￢ﾀﾙs Likud in the 2015 elections for the Twentieth Knesset, and Livni again served as Head of the Opposition
Livni and her Hatunah party did not pass the electoral threshold in the 2019 elections for the Twenty-First Knesset
Following those elections, Livni announced her plan to retire from Israeli politics in February 2019
