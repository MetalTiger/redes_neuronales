There was talk of a potential run in the 2000 presidential race by Gore as early as January 1998
" [53] [114] Cerf would later state: "Al Gore had seen what happened with the National Interstate and Defense Highways Act of 1956 , which his father introduced as a military bill
Gore is not the Father of the Internet, but in all fairness, Gore is the person who, in the Congress, most systematically worked to make sure that we got to an Internet, and the truth is￢ﾀﾔand I worked with him starting in 1978 when I got [to Congress], we were both part of a "futures group"￢ﾀﾔthe fact is, in the Clinton administration, the world we had talked about in the '80s began to actually happen
" [118] Finally, Wolf Blitzer (who conducted the original 1999 interview) stated in 2008 that: "I didn't ask him about the Internet
" [120] In 2005 when Gore was awarded the Lifetime Achievement Award "for three decades of contributions to the Internet" at the Webby Awards [121] [122] he joked in his acceptance speech (limited to five words according to Webby Awards rules): "Please don't recount this vote
While Bill Clinton's job-approval ratings were around 60%, an April 1999 study by the Pew Research Center for the People found that respondents suffered from "Clinton fatigue" where they were "tired of all the problems associated with the Clinton administration" including the Lewinsky scandal and impeachment
Gore eventually went on to win every primary and caucus and, in March 2000 even won the first primary election ever held over the Internet, the Arizona Presidential Primary
[133] Gore's daughter, Karenna, together with her father's former Harvard roommate Tommy Lee Jones , [134] officially nominated Gore as the Democratic presidential candidate during the 2000 Democratic National Convention in Los Angeles, California
In his speeches Khamenei regularly mentions many familiar themes of the 1979 revolution: justice, independence, self-sufficiency, Islamic government and resolute opposition to Israel and United States, while rarely mentioning other revolutionary ideals such as democracy and greater government transparency
Bill Clinton and Gore had maintained an informal public distance for eight years, but they reunited for the media in August 2009
[147] In May 2018, he was included as a member of the Indian Government committee to coordinate year long celebrations of Mahatma Gandhi's 150th birth anniversary from October 2, 2019
But look at the differences between the resolution that was voted on in 1991 and the one this administration is proposing that the Congress vote on in 2002
" [155] Gore's 2007 book, The Assault on Reason , is an analysis of what Gore refers to as the "emptying out of the marketplace of ideas " in civic discourse during the Bush administration
" [157] In a 2009 interview with CNN , Gore commented on former Vice President Dick Cheney 's criticism of the Obama administration
People were speculating that Gore would be a candidate for the 2004 presidential election (a bumper sticker, "Re-elect Gore in 2004
[161] On December 16, 2002, however, Gore announced that he would not run in 2004
[162] While Gore seriously considered challenging Bush in 2004, the 9/11 attacks and the subsequent stratospheric rise in President Bush's popularity as a result of his response to these attacks were strong factors in Gore's December 2002 decision not to run again in 2004
The prospect of a Gore candidacy arose again between 2006 and early 2008 in light of the upcoming 2008 presidential election
[165] [166] [167] This was due in part to his increased popularity after the release of the 2006 documentary, An Inconvenient Truth
" [169] After An Inconvenient Truth was nominated for an Academy Award , Donna Brazile (Gore's campaign chairwoman from his 2000 campaign) speculated that Gore might announce a possible presidential candidacy during the Oscars
Interest in having Gore run for the 2016 presidential election arose in 2014 and again in 2015, although he did not declare any intention to do so
After announcing he would not run in the 2004 U
[185] Later, in March 2004, Gore endorsed John Kerry and gave Kerry $6million in funds left over from his own unsuccessful 2000 bid
[186] Gore also opened the 2004 Democratic National Convention
During the 2008 primaries , Gore remained neutral toward all of the candidates [188] which led to speculation that he would come out of a brokered 2008 Democratic National Convention as a "compromise candidate" if the party decided it could not nominate one
The fatwa was cited in an official statement by the Iranian government at an August 2005 meeting of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) in Vienna
[131] Khamenei's official website specifically cites a 2010 version [132] of these statements in the fatwa section of the website in Farsi as a fatwa on "Prohibition of Weapons of Mass Destruction"
; and (5) most significant[ly], the 2005 presidential election, which saw hardliner Mahmoud Ahmadinejad trounce Khamenei's chief rival
[199] [200] [201] [202] On the timing and nature of Gore's endorsement, some argued that Gore waited because he did not want to repeat his calamitous early endorsement of Howard Dean during the 2004 presidential election
[203] [204] On the final night of the 2008 Democratic National Convention , shortly before Obama delivered his acceptance address, Gore gave a speech offering his full support
" [152] According to The Daily Telegraph , money from Setad is used to fund Khamenei's Beit Rahbari compound, which employs over 500 stewards, as was reported in 2013
[205] [206] Such support led to new speculation after Obama was elected president during the 2008 presidential election that Gore would be named a member of the Obama administration
This speculation was enhanced by a meeting held between Obama, Gore, and Joe Biden in Chicago on December 9, 2008
Gore repeated his neutrality eight years later during the Democratic presidential primaries of 2016 until endorsing Hillary Clinton on July 25, 2016, the first day of that year's Democratic National Convention
[210] Gore appeared with her at a rally on Miami Dade College's Kendall Campus on October 11, 2016
In an interview in October 2014 with Islamic Republic News Agency , Muhammad Mukhber , the head of Setad, stated that over 90% of profits from Setad business activities are spent on improving infrastructure in the poor regions of the country, creating jobs and improving the well-being of people in these regions reflecting the top concerns of Iran's Supreme Leader, Khamenei for the Iranian society
He also envisioned construction and delivery of 17 thousands housing units to families in poor regions of Iran by 2018

Gore has been involved with environmental issues since 1976 when as a freshman congressman, he held the "first congressional hearings on the climate change, and co-sponsor[ed] hearings on toxic waste and global warming"
[222] In a 2014 interview, Gore said "Over a year ago I changed my diet to a vegan diet, really just to experiment to see what it was like
Gore's An Inconvenient Sequel: Truth to Power , a sequel to his 2006 film, An Inconvenient Truth , premiered at the 2017 Sundance Film Festival
A "Climate and Health Summit" which was originally going to be held by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention , was cancelled without warning in late January 2017
[226] [227] In 2020 he helped to launch Climate TRACE to independently monitor global greenhouse gas emissions
In November 2021, Gore spoke at the early stages of the 2021 United Nations Climate Change Conference (COP26) in Glasgow , Scotland
[229] He later criticised the Morrison Government for failing to increase Australia's 2030 emissions reduction target
[232] [233] Additionally, he has been criticized for his above-average energy consumption in using private jets, and in owning multiple, very large homes, [234] one of which was reported in 2007 as using high amounts of electricity
In a 2007 court case , a British judge said that while he had "no doubt
Gore's spokesperson responded in 2007 that the court had upheld the film's fundamental thesis and its use as an educational tool
" [158] In Ahmadinejad's 2005 inauguration the supreme leader allowed Ahmadinejad to kiss his hand and cheeks in what was called "a sign of closeness and loyalty," [159] and after the 2009 election fully endorsed Ahmadinejad against protesters
[160] However, as early as January 2008 signs of disagreement between the two men developed over domestic policies, [157] and by the period of 2010￢ﾀﾓ11 several sources detected a "growing rift" between them
Gore was also criticized when in 2012 he sold his television channel Current TV for around $100million to Al Jazeera , a media company funded by the government of Qatar , a nation largely dependent on income from the fossil fuel industry

[254] He was elected to the American Philosophical Society in 2008
[255] He also starred in the 2006 documentary An Inconvenient Truth , which won an Academy Award for Best Documentary in 2007 and wrote the book An Inconvenient Truth: The Planetary Emergency of Global Warming and What We Can Do About It , which won a Grammy Award for Best Spoken Word Album in 2009
During the 2005 presidential election, Khamenei's comments about importance of fighting corruption, being faithful to the ideals of the Islamic revolution, as well as on the superior intelligence and dynamism of those who studied engineering, were interpreted by some as a subtle endorsement of Mahmoud Ahmadinejad (who had a PhD in traffic engineering)
Khamenei would later certify the results of the 2009 Iranian Presidential election

From 1963 he was actively involved in protests against the monarchy, for which he was imprisoned several times by Iran￢ﾀﾙs security services
Khamenei remained closely associated with the exiled Khomeini during this time and immediately after the latter￢ﾀﾙs return to Iran in 1979 was appointed to the Revolutionary Council
He was injured in 1981 in one of a series of terrorist bombings that devastated the IRP￢ﾀﾙs upper echelon

His relations with reformist president Mohammad Khatami , however, who served from 1997 to 2005, were strained

Rouhani won reelection in 2017 in a landslide, but the benefits of lifted sanctions and resolution of the nuclear issue were short-lived

Fu insignito del Premio Nobel per la pace 2007 e del Premio Principe delle Asturie per la Cooperazione Internazionale 2007 per il suo impegno in difesa dell'ambiente
Membro del Partito Democratico , si ￃﾨ seduto per il Tennessee nella Camera dei rappresentanti dal 1977 al 1985 e poi al Senato dal 1985 al 1993 , prima di essere eletto vicepresidente di Bill Clinton nelle elezioni del 1992 e del 1996
ￃﾈ stato candidato alla presidenza alle elezioni del 2000
Dopo la laurea all' Universitￃﾠ di Harvard , nel 1969 svolge il servizio militare in Vietnam per due anni nella 20ￂﾪ Brigata Ingegneri, in cui opera anche come reporter e giornalista , narrando gli eventi della guerra , a cui era contrario [1]
Inizia la carriera politica nel 1976 , quando ￃﾨ eletto per il Tennessee al Congresso degli Stati Uniti
ￃﾈ eletto al Senato nel 1984 e rieletto nel 1990
Tra i due mandati, nel 1988 , si svolgono le elezioni primarie del Partito Democratico per la nomination a sfidante di George Bush alle elezioni presidenziali dello stesso anno
Il 3 aprile 1989 il figlio Albert ￃﾨ coinvolto in un incidente stradale, il piccolo aveva lasciato la mano del padre ed era corso in mezzo alla strada dove era stato, poi, investito da una macchina il cui guidatore affermava di non averlo visto: per molto tempo le condizioni del bambino, che aveva sei anni, rimasero molto critiche, dovendo ricorrere a lungo a un respiratore artificiale
Per assisterlo Gore si ritira dalla campagna elettorale per le primarie del 1992
Il 9 luglio 1992 Bill Clinton sceglie Al Gore come suo candidato vicepresidente
I fatti smentiscono questa analisi: il ticket Clinton-Gore vince le elezioni del 1992 ed ottiene la conferma nelle elezioni del 1996
Molti storici considerano Al Gore uno dei vicepresidenti piￃﾹ influenti della storia americana: durante i suoi due mandati ha parte attiva a numerose riunioni internazionali e dibattiti pubblici, favorisce la diffusione di internet e dei nuovi mezzi di comunicazione, approva le campagne militari contro Slobodan Miloￅﾡeviￄﾇ e Saddam Hussein ( Operazione Desert Fox del 1998 ), si schiera a favore del protocollo di Kyￅﾍto
Dopo otto anni di vicepresidenza, nel 2000 Gore ￃﾨ il candidato alla Casa Bianca del Partito Democratico alle elezioni presidenziali
Dopo la sconfitta elettorale, Gore si allontana parzialmente dalla politica, anche se non risparmia critiche all'Amministrazione Bush, soprattutto per la gestione dell' uragano Katrina del 2005
Decide di non candidarsi alle primarie democratiche del 2008 in alternativa a Hillary Clinton e a Barack Obama
Di religione battista , Al Gore ￃﾨ stato sposato dal 19 maggio 1970 al giugno 2010 con Tipper Gore , da cui ha avuto quattro figli: Karenna (nata nel 1973 ), Kristin Carlson (nata nel 1977 ), Sarah LaFon (nata nel 1979 ) e Albert Gore III (nato nel 1982 )
Nel giugno del 2010 la coppia si ￃﾨ separata consensualmente
Nel 2006 ￃﾨ protagonista del documentario Una scomoda veritￃﾠ ( An Inconvenient Truth ) sui pericoli e sulle ripercussioni del riscaldamento globale della Terra , presentato al Festival di Cannes e premiato nel 2007 durante la 79ￂﾪ edizione dei Premi Oscar come miglior documentario e miglior canzone ( I need to wake up , di Melissa Etheridge )
Organizza il concerto Live Earth del 7 luglio 2007
Nel 2007 vince insieme all' Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change il Premio Nobel per la pace ￂﾫ
dal 2003 e lavora come consulente senior presso Google Inc
Nel 2005 l'Accademia Internazionale delle Arti Digitali e delle Scienze ha onorato Gore ai Webby Awards con il Lifetime Achievement Award ￂﾫper tre decenni di contributi a Internetￂﾻ
Il 4 maggio del 2004 fonda il network televisivo Current TV : un canale interattivo pensato per un pubblico giovane, che ￃﾨ andato in onda anche in Italia sulla piattaforma satellitare di Sky dal maggio 2008 al luglio 2011

Though Gore came in second in the electoral vote, he received 547,398 more popular votes than Bush, [53] making him the first person since Grover Cleveland in 1888 to win the popular vote but lose in the Electoral College
[54] Gore failed to win the popular vote in his home state, Tennessee , which both he and his father had represented in the Senate, making him the first major-party presidential candidate to have lost his home state since George McGovern lost South Dakota in 1972
This was the first time since 1928 in which a non-incumbent Republican candidate won West Virginia
The Electoral College results were the closest since 1876
Garfield in 1880 was the first) or Pennsylvania ( Richard Nixon in 1968 was the first), and the first winning Republican not to receive any electoral votes from California (Garfield received one vote in 1880)
This marked the first time since Iowa entered the union in 1846 in which the state voted for a Democratic presidential candidate in four elections in a row (1988, 1992, 1996, and 2000), and the last time until 2020 that Iowa did not vote for the overall winner
There were two counties in the nation that had voted Republican in 1996 and voted Democratic in 2000: Charles County, Maryland , and Orange County, Florida , both rapidly diversifying counties
The 2000 election was also the last time a Republican won a number of populous urban counties that have since turned into Democratic strongholds
In 2016 , Republican Donald Trump lost Mecklenburg by 30%, Marion by 23%, Fairfax by 36%, and Travis by 38%
Conversely, as of 2021 Gore is the last Democrat to have won any counties at all in Oklahoma
When adding Smith's 5,775 Arizona votes to Browne's 384,431 votes nationwide, that brings the total presidential votes cast for the Libertarian Party in 2000 to 390,206
Bush took the oath of office on January 20, 2001
Gore has not, as of 2021, considered another presidential run, endorsing Howard Dean 's candidacy during the 2004 Democratic primary and remaining neutral in the Democratic primaries of 2008, 2016 and 2020
Further, according to sociologists Christopher Uggen and Jeff Manza, the 2000 election might have gone to Gore if the disenfranchised population of Florida had voted
In a 2002 American Sociological Review article, Uggen and Manza found that the released felon vote could have altered the outcome of seven senatorial races between 1978 and 2000, and the 2000 presidential election
Because the 2000 presidential election was so close in Florida, the federal government and state governments pushed for election reform to be prepared by the 2004 presidential election
Many of Florida's 2000 election night problems stemmed from usability and ballot design factors with voting systems, including the potentially confusing " butterfly ballot
The 2000 presidential election spurred the debate about election and voting reform but did not end it
But the electronic voting systems that many states purchased to comply with HAVA actually caused problems in the 2004 presidential election
The Voter News Service 's reputation was damaged by its treatment of Florida's presidential vote in 2000
" Due in part to this (and other polling inaccuracies) the VNS was disbanded in 2003
A study of the calls made on election night 2000 indicated that states carried by Gore were called more quickly than states won by Bush; [89] however, notable states carried by Bush, such as New Hampshire and Florida, were very close, and close states won by Gore, such as Iowa, Oregon, New Mexico and Wisconsin, were called late as well
Mother Jones also cited a Public Citizen letter sent out to people interested in Nader's relation with the organization at that time, with the disclaimer: "Although Ralph Nader was our founder, he has not held an official position in the organization since 1980 and does not serve on the board
In their 2007 book The Nightly News Nightmare: Network Television's Coverage of US Presidential Elections, 1988￢ﾀﾓ2004 , professors Stephen J
Peter Hart and Jim Naureckas, two commentators for Fairness and Accuracy in Reporting (FAIR), called the media "serial exaggerators" and took the view that several media outlets were constantly exaggerating criticism of Gore: [100] they further argued that the media falsely claimed Gore lied when he claimed he spoke in an overcrowded science class in Sarasota, Florida, [100] and that the media gave Bush a pass on certain issues, such as Bush allegedly exaggerating how much money he signed into the annual Texas state budget to help the uninsured during his second debate with Gore in October 2000
[100] In the April 2000 issue of Washington Monthly , columnist Robert Parry wrote that media outlets exaggerated Gore's supposed claim that he "discovered" the Love Canal neighborhood in Niagara Falls, New York during a campaign speech in Concord, New Hampshire on November 30, 1999, [101] when he had only claimed he "found" it after it was already evacuated in 1978 because of chemical contamination
[103] [104] [105] [106] [107] [108] The number of lawsuits brought over election issues more than doubled following the 2000 election cycle, an increase Richard L

Pada tahun 1890 , semasa berusia sepuluh tahun, Abdul Aziz mengikuti keluarganya dalam pengasingan di Kuwait setelah dikalahkan oleh dinasti Rashidi , saat itu Nejd bukan bagian dari Kesultanan Utsmani, melainkan daerah merdeka yang dikuasai oleh beberapa kabilah suku
Pada tahun 1902 , dia bersama-sama dengan pasukan keluarga dan saudaranya berhasil merebut Riyadh
Meskipun begitu, pada tahun 1904 , dinasti Rashidi meminta bantuan dari Kesultanan Utsmaniyah untuk mengalahkan dinasti Saud ( Keluarga Kerajaan Saudi )
Kerajaan Utsmaniyah mengirimkan pasukan ke Arabia (Tanah Arab) dan ini menyebabkan kekalahan dinasti Saud pada 15 Juni 1904 , namun setelah pasukan Utsmaniyah mundur disebabkan masalah tertentu, pasukan dinasti Saud berhasil mengumpulkan kembali kekuatannya
Pada tahun 1932 , setelah menguasai sebagian besar Jazirah Arab dari musuh-musuhnya, Abdul Aziz menamakan tanah gabungan Hijaz dan Nejd sebagai Arab Saudi
Setelah minyak bumi ditemukan di Arab Saudi pada tahun 1938 , Abdul Aziz memberikan izin bagi perusahaan-perusahaan Amerika Serikat dan sekutunya untuk melakukan eksplorasi minyak di wilayah Arab Saudi
Pada tahun 1948 , saat Perang Arab-Israel 1948 meletus, Abdul Aziz mengikuti peperangan tersebut

In the CCP's official discourse, the "generational" division and identification of the " core leader " for each of the first, second and third generations was set down during the leadership of Jiang Zemin and first publicised in 1999
Xi Jinping did continue this practice until October 2016 when the 6th Plenary of the 18th Central Committee named him as the "core leader" in a document
First generation [ edit ] First generation leaders (from left) Zhu De , Mao Zedong , Chen Yun and Zhou Enlai in Zhongnanhai in 1954
Although the first generation of leaders ruled collectively for only part of the period, and Mao Zedong was to a large extent a paramount, autocratic leader for most of the period, the successive leaders from the founding of the People's Republic in 1949 until Mao's death and the dismantling of the power of his closest deputies in 1976 are now referred to retrospectively as the "first generation" of leaders in official discourse
Thus, the first generation, from 1949 to 1976, consisted of Mao Zedong as core, along with Zhou Enlai , Zhu De (as informal triumvirate ), [3] Liu Shaoqi , Chen Yun , Deng Xiaoping , Peng Dehuai , and Lin Biao
They were born between 1886 and 1907, although the Gang of Four were a distinct subgroup born 1914 to 1935
Of this group, Mao, Zhou, Zhu and Liu were the four original members of the collective leadership from 1949 until the political turmoil of the late 1950s and early 1960s, which resulted in Mao gaining paramount autocratic power
Liu, then the President (or "Chairman of the State"), was removed from his party position in 1966, placed under house arrest in 1967, and died from torture and maltreatment in 1969
[ citation needed ] Mao, Zhou and Zhu were the only three original members of the Politburo Standing Committee of the Chinese Communist Party who remained in the Politburo from 1945 until their deaths in 1976 (though Zhu temporarily lost his membership between 1969 and 1973) and died while holding the highest party and state offices Chairman of the Chinese Communist Party (Mao), Premier of the State Council (Zhou) and Chairman of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress , the nominal head of state (Zhu)
Lin fell out of favour, however, and died in 1971 while attempting to escape to the Soviet Union
The Gang of Four, which consisted of Jiang Qing (Madame Mao), and three other members meteorically promoted in the late 1960s, were the only members of the first generation of leadership to remain after Mao's death in 1976
Peng Dehuai was denounced in 1959, made a brief return to government in 1965, but was detained by Red Guards from 1966 and died in prison from torture and maltreatment in 1974
Deng Xiaoping , the core of the second generation of leadership, also played a key role in the first generation at various times, mainly as an ally of Zhou and Peng, but was purged from government in 1976 and remained sidelined at the time of Mao's death
The era began with Hua Guofeng as the successor to Mao, but his position was soon eclipsed by the ascendancy of Deng Xiaoping as the paramount leader, in which position he remained at least until 1989 when he resigned from his leadership positions
Thus, in official discourse, the second generation of leadership lasted from 1976 to 1992
These leaders were also involved in the Chinese revolution, but with the exception of Deng Xiaoping, served in more junior roles, as they were all born from 1897 to 1921 (that is, some were born after the demise of the Qing Empire in the Xinhai Revolution )
Yang Shangkun played a brief but important role in the period between 1989 and 1992, when as president he subverted the existing constitutional convention and turned the office of President from a symbolic role into an executive one
The transition towards the third generation of leadership began with the Tiananmen Square protests of 1989
Soon afterwards, Deng resigned his last major party post, as chairman of the central military committee, although he remained influential behind the scenes until his death in 1997
Between 1989 and 1992, Jiang was believed to be simply a transitional figure to protect the party from a power vacuum (or even an Eastern Bloc style collapse) until a more stable successor government to Deng Xiaoping could be put in place
Thus, the "third generation" lasted from 1992 to 2002, with Jiang Zemin as core, and other leaders including Li Peng , Zhu Rongji , Qiao Shi , Li Ruihuan , Liu Huaqing , Hu Jintao , Wei Jianxing , and Li Lanqing
These leaders were born before the revolution from 1924 to 1934 but were educated afterwards before the Sino-Soviet split
Notable changes to the leadership were the elevation of Zhu Rongji in place of Li Peng as premier in 1998 and the elevation of Hu Jintao as vice president
2002 saw the first orderly transition of power in the Chinese Communist Party in accordance with rules on term limits
But Hu Jintao did not become the chairman of the Central Military Commission until September 2004
[ citation needed ] These were promoted to top leadership at the 16th Party Congress and remained in power until the 18th Party Congress in 2012
This generation of leaders, born mainly in the World War II years from 1939 to 1944, represented a new technocratic style governance and a less centralized political structure
Most of the fifth generation of civilian leadership, born in the postwar years 1945 to 1955, were educated at top Chinese universities
The sixth generation of leaders had been expected to come to power at the 20th Party Congress in 2022
Hu and Sun Zhengcai were the only Politburo members named at the 18th Party Congress in 2012 who were born after 1960, making their further advancement seem like a certainty, but Sun was purged before the 19th Party Congress

(Jixi, 1942) Pol&iacute;tico chino que fue presidente de la Rep&uacute;blica desde 2003 hasta 2013
Su padre fue considerado un peque&ntilde;o burgu&eacute;s, propietario o comerciante en la escala social establecida por los comunistas en 1949
En 1968 fue enviado a la lejana provincia de Gansu para trabajar en un proyecto de su especialidad: obras de irrigaci&oacute;n y construcci&oacute;n de la presa de las gargantas de Liujia en el Huang He (r&iacute;o Amarillo)
Tras el ascenso al poder de Deng Xiaoping (1978), Hu Jintao retorn&oacute; a Pek&iacute;n en 1981 para estudiar en la Escuela Central del partido, donde conoci&oacute; a Hu Yaobang , flamante secretario general del PCCh, que se encarg&oacute; de acelerar su carrera al promoverlo a secretario del comit&eacute; provincial de la Liga de las Juventudes Comunistas en 1982 y miembro suplente del comit&eacute; central
Hu Jintao fue el primer dirigente no militar en asumir la direcci&oacute;n del PCCh en el agitado T&iacute;bet entre 1988 y 1992
Impresionado por su actuaci&oacute;n en el T&iacute;bet, el entonces patriarca Deng Xiaoping lo se&ntilde;al&oacute; como uno de sus probables delfines, en v&iacute;speras de la sangrienta represi&oacute;n de la disidencia en la plaza de Tiananmen de Pek&iacute;n, en junio de 1989
En 1993 pas&oacute; de alumno a director de la Escuela Central del partido, dominada por los ep&iacute;gonos de Deng Xiaoping, partidarios de la econom&iacute;a de mercado seg&uacute;n el criterio de &laquo;un pa&iacute;s, dos sistemas&raquo;
Confirmado en todos sus cargos por el XV Congreso del PCCh (septiembre de 1997), la Asamblea Nacional Popular lo eligi&oacute; vicepresidente de la rep&uacute;blica en marzo de 1998 y sucesor designado de Jiang Zemin , aunque en ese momento, tras el fallecimiento de Deng, ocupaba el quinto lugar en la jerarqu&iacute;a
Culmin&oacute; su carrera al ser designado vicepresidente de la Comisi&oacute;n Militar Central en septiembre de 1999
Para preparar su llegada al poder supremo y paliar al mismo tiempo su falta de experiencia internacional, Hu Jintao dedic&oacute; buena parte de 2001 a viajar al extranjero

Washington (CNN) Federal election regulators fined Hillary Clinton's 2016 presidential campaign and the Democratic National Committee earlier this month for not properly disclosing the money they spent on controversial opposition research that led to the infamous Trump-Russia dossier
It contained unverified and salacious allegations about Donald Trump, including claims that his campaign colluded with the Kremlin to win the 2016 election
A DNC spokesman told CNN Wednesday that it has "settled aging and silly" FEC complaints about 2016
They've also said the Trump campaign's links to Russia posed a national security risk -- which was the same conclusion reached by a bipartisan Senate probe in 2020

Broadwell, then a United States Army Reserve lieutenant colonel , first met Petraeus at Harvard University in 2006
Agents had confronted Broadwell on November 2, 2012
In late October 2012 he phoned two US Representatives , Republicans Dave Reichert and Eric Cantor , and said that he believed the US Department of Justice was covering up the case
He served as director of the Central Intelligence Agency from September 6, 2011, [10] until his resignation on November 9, 2012
This set off a chain of events that eventually led to Petraeus's resignation on November 9, 2012
According to White House sources, both Kelley and Khawam visited the White House three times from September to November 2012
Khawam had a relationship with Gerald Harrington, the vice chair of finance for John Kerry's 2004 presidential campaign
In November 2012 Humphries remained under investigation by the Office of Professional Responsibility , the internal-affairs arm of the United States Department of Justice
In May 2010 Humphries killed a retired Army Ranger at the MacDill Air Force Base main gate after the retiree brandished a knife and was said to have threatened the lives of base security officials and Humphries
[52] Scott Broadwell and his future wife Paula Kranz met in 2000 when they were both active duty US Army captains

Bergen has reported from Afghanistan since 1993
(CNN) General David Petraeus called the Taliban takeover "hugely disheartening and sad" and said that the stage was set for the chaos now unfolding in Afghanistan by the US peace negotiations with the Taliban by the Trump administration in 2018 that excluded the elected Afghan government
Peter Bergen Petraeus was deeply immersed in the war in Afghanistan, first as the commander of Central Command (CENTCOM) that oversaw the war in Afghanistan until 2010; then as the ground commander leading the war in Afghanistan , and subsequently as the Director of the CIA in 2011, overseeing all of the agency's operation and intelligence-gathering in Afghanistan until 2012
Beyond that, the Administration has also sought to sustain commitments in most other locations where there are Islamist extremists; in fact, President Biden and other members of his Administration know from the withdrawal of all US troops from Iraq in late 2011 that one must keep pressure on extremist groups or they will reconstitute and cause new problems as was the case with ISIS in Iraq after our departure, which subsequently caused enormous problems in Iraq and Syria and, to a degree, Europe
Moreover, all who served there should take considerable pride in having provided Afghanistan and the Afghan people some 20 years of relative freedom and opportunity compared to the situation under the Taliban before we ousted that regime in late 2001

Furse struggled initially to convince UK lawmakers that she was suitable as a member of the FPC, a new watchdog launched in 2013 which at the time needed to muster credibility quickly
When Furse, a former derivatives trader, headed the London Stock Exchange she lost out in 2001 to Paris-based Euronext ENX
Failing to acquire LIFFE left the LSE vulnerable and led to Furse fighting off a series of takeover bids before stepping down in 2009

He has significantly exploited the re-election of the KMT in Taiwan in 2008 by sanctioning the signing with the Taiwanese government of a major free trade deal, the Economic Cooperation Framework Agreement, in 2010
He allowed China to take a major part in the global reaction to the economic crisis from 2008
As a government who has stated that one of their main goals was to create a &lsquo;harmonious society,&rsquo; China often appears anything but, and the &lsquo;socialist countryside&rsquo; Hu talked of during the last 2007 Party Congress often seems a place riven by anger, frustration, poverty and protest

The surge led by Petraeus in 2007 will certainly be entombed in the annals of history as one of the greatest military about-faces on the battlefield; however, in Petraeus&rsquo; opinion, it was a surge of ideas that was even more important than the surge of forces
10 This essay will detail how General Petraeus developed his view of strategic leadership and applied these concepts successfully during the surge in Iraq from 2007 to 2008
For the Autumn 1986 edition of Parameters, Petraeus would write an article entitled &ldquo;Lessons of History and Lessons of Vietnam
Later, Petraeus&rsquo; fifteen months as the CAC Commander from 2005 to 2007 at Fort Leavenworth, served as a time where he could apply intellectual rigor to capture and hone those ideas
Recognizing the security of people, the military had to reverse a trend starting in 2004 of moving away from population centers onto super-bases
However, after the Spring 2007 riots involving about 9,000 detainees, Petraeus knew that big ideas were needed to guide detainee operations

Chris Richards, in review of a 2017 concert, declared "John Mayer is an amazing guitar player", though he says he did so "through clenched teeth", adding that the fact should not absolve the guitarist of "his pillow-soft songcraft, the dull sentimentality of his lyrics, or that cuckoo-racist interview he gave to Playboy back in 2010"

However, following Mitt Romney's 2016 anti-Trump speech , McCain endorsed the sentiments expressed in that speech, saying he had serious concerns about Trump's "uninformed and indeed dangerous statements on national security issues"

In 1997 Mayer enrolled at&#xA0;Berklee College of Music, but he quit two semesters later with his friend Clay Cook
In 2001 Mayer released his first full-length album&#xA0; Room for Squares , which spawned hits like&#xA0;"No Such Thing," "Your Body Is a Wonderland," and&#xA0;"Why Georgia
" The album was critically praised and a multi-platinum commercial success, winning&#xA0;Mayer a Grammy for&#xA0;Best Male Pop Vocal Performance&#xA0;in 2003 for "Your Body Is a Wonderland
In 2005 Mayer began shifting his musical direction, focusing on the genre he first fell in love with: the blues
In 2006 Mayer released his third studio album, Continuum , which received a Grammy for Best Pop Album and another Grammy for its single&#xA0;"Waiting on the World to Change
" With yet another huge success under his belt, Mayer felt skittish with starting a follow-up album, but he forged ahead with the release of Battle Studie s in 2009
However, in 2011 he discovered he had a&#xA0;granuloma&#xA0;on his vocal chords and had to undergo extensive treatments, delaying the release of his album Born and Raised&#xA0; until 2012

Breaking from his 2001 and 2003 votes, McCain supported the Bush tax cut extension in May 2006, saying not to do so would amount to a tax increase
The Secure America and Orderly Immigration Act was never voted on in 2005, while the Comprehensive Immigration Reform Act of 2006 passed the Senate in May 2006 but failed in the House
[163] In June 2007, President Bush, McCain, and others made the strongest push yet for such a bill, the Comprehensive Immigration Reform Act of 2007 , but it aroused intense grassroots opposition among talk radio listeners and others, some of whom furiously characterized the proposal as an "amnesty" program, [175] and the bill twice failed to gain cloture in the Senate
[177] [178] By 2005 and 2006, McCain was pushing for amendments to the Indian Gaming Regulatory Act that would limit creation of off-reservation casinos, [92] as well as limiting the movement of tribes across state lines to build casinos
Although Bush had threatened to veto the bill if McCain's amendment was included, [181] the President announced in December 2005 that he accepted McCain's terms and would "make it clear to the world that this government does not torture and that we adhere to the international convention of torture, whether it be here at home or abroad"
[183] McCain voted in February 2008 against a bill containing a ban on waterboarding , [184] which provision was later narrowly passed and vetoed by Bush
" [163] From the beginning, McCain strongly supported the Iraq troop surge of 2007
Formally announcing his intention to run for the Presidency in Portsmouth, New Hampshire in 2007
McCain's oft-cited strengths as a presidential candidate for 2008 included national name recognition, sponsorship of major lobbying and campaign finance reform initiatives, his ability to reach across the aisle, his well-known military service and experience as a POW, his experience from the 2000 presidential campaign, and an expectation that he would capture Bush's top fundraisers
[193] During the 2006 election cycle, McCain had attended 346events [55] and helped raise more than $10
[194] Despite being considered the front-runner for the nomination by pundits as 2007 began, [195] McCain was in second place behind former Mayor of New York City Rudy Giuliani in national Republican polls as the year progressed
McCain had fundraising problems in the first half of 2007, due in part to his support for the Comprehensive Immigration Reform Act of 2007 , which was unpopular among the Republican base electorate
[201] McCain was showing a resurgence, in particular with renewed strength in New Hampshire￢ﾀﾓ the scene of his 2000 triumph￢ﾀﾓ and was bolstered further by the endorsements of The Boston Globe , the New Hampshire Union Leader , and almost two dozen other state newspapers, [202] as well as from Senator Lieberman (now an Independent Democrat )
Also, if inaugurated in 2009 at age 72years and 144days, he would have been the oldest U
[215] McCain has addressed concerns about his age and past health concerns, stating in 2005 that his health was "excellent"
[216] He has been treated for a type of skin cancer called melanoma, and an operation in 2000 for that condition left a noticeable mark on the left side of his face
[222] After facing criticism about lobbyists on staff, the McCain campaign issued new rules in May 2008 to avoid conflicts of interest , causing five top aides to leave
[199] [228] McCain accepted public financing for the general election campaign, and the restrictions that go with it, while criticizing his Democratic opponent for becoming the first major party candidate to opt out of such financing for the general election since the system was implemented in 1976
Alaska Governor Sarah Palin was revealed as McCain's surprise choice for running mate on August 29, 2008
On September 3, 2008, McCain and Palin became the Republican Party's presidential and Vice Presidential nominees, respectively, at the 2008 Republican National Convention in Saint Paul, Minnesota
[255] In mid-November 2008 he met with President-elect Obama, and the two discussed issues they had commonality on
[256] Around the same time, McCain indicated that he intended to run for re-election to his Senate seat in 2010
Nevertheless, McCain emerged as a leader of the Republican opposition to the Obama economic stimulus package of 2009 , saying it had too much spending for too little stimulative effect
[260] McCain also voted against Obama's Supreme Court nomination of Sonia Sotomayor ￢ﾀﾓ saying that while undeniably qualified, "I do not believe that she shares my belief in judicial restraint" [261] ￢ﾀﾓ and by August 2009 was siding more often with his Republican Party on closely divided votes than ever before in his senatorial career
Hayworth materialized in the 2010 U
" [270] McCain became a vocal defender of Arizona SB 1070 , the April 2010 tough anti-illegal immigration state law that aroused national controversy, saying that the state had been forced to take action given the federal government's inability to control the border
In the lame duck session of the 111th Congress, McCain voted for the compromise Tax Relief, Unemployment Insurance Reauthorization, and Job Creation Act of 2010 , [274] but against the DREAM Act (which he had once sponsored) and the New START Treaty
[277] McCain was an especially vocal supporter of the 2011 military intervention in Libya
[278] In August, McCain voted for the Budget Control Act of 2011 that resolved the U
[279] In November, McCain and Senator Carl Levin were leaders in efforts to codify in the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2012 that terrorism suspects, no matter where captured, could be detained by the U
In the 2012 Republican Party presidential primaries, McCain endorsed former 2008 rival Mitt Romney and campaigned for him, but compared the contest to a Greek tragedy due to its drawn-out nature with massive Super PAC-funded attack ads damaging all the contenders
[282] He labelled the Supreme Court's 2010 Citizens United v
[283] McCain took the lead in opposing the defense spending sequestrations brought on by the Budget Control Act of 2011 and gained attention for defending State Department aide Huma Abedin against charges brought by a few House Republicans that she had ties to the Muslim Brotherhood
[287] Following the 2013 Ghouta chemical weapons attack , McCain argued again for strong American military action against the government Syrian President Bashar al-Assad , and in September 2013 cast a Foreign Relations committee vote in favor of Obama's request to Congress that it authorize a military response
[288] McCain took the lead in criticizing a growing non-interventionist movement within the Republican Party, exemplified by his March 2013 comment that Senators Rand Paul and Ted Cruz and Representative Justin Amash were "wacko birds"
[290] The resulting Border Security, Economic Opportunity, and Immigration Modernization Act of 2013 passed the Senate by a 68￢ﾀﾓ32 margin, but faced an uncertain future in the House
federal government shutdown of 2013 and U
debt-ceiling crisis of 2013 in order to defund or delay the Affordable Care Act; in October 2013 he voted in favor of the Continuing Appropriations Act, 2014 , which resolved them and said, "Republicans have to understand we have lost this battle, as I predicted weeks ago, that we would not be able to win because we were demanding something that was not achievable
[299] The American Conservative Union has awarded McCain a lifetime rating of 83percent through 2012, while McCain has an average lifetime 12percent "Liberal Quotient" from Americans for Democratic Action through 2011

From the late 1990s until 2008, McCain was a board member of Project Vote Smart which was set up by Richard Kimball, his 1986 Senate opponent
[55] [308] [312] [315] McCain's shift of political stances and attitudes during and especially after the 2008 presidential campaign, including his self-repudiation of the maverick label, left many writers expressing sadness and wondering what had happened to the McCain they thought they had known
[320] Other traits include a penchant for lucky charms, [321] a fondness for hiking, [322] and a sense of humor that has sometimes backfired spectacularly, as when he made a joke in 1998 about the Clintons widely deemed not fit to print in newspapers: "Do you know why Chelsea Clinton is so ugly
[21] [343] [344] His daughter Meghan became a blogging and Twittering presence in the debate about the future of the Republican Party following the 2008 elections, and showed some of his maverick tendencies

John McCain was well known for his long career in Congress and his two attempts at the presidency, particularly his most recent run against Barack Obama in the 2008 presidential election
True to form, McCain continued striving to serve his country even after being diagnosed with a malignant brain tumor in 2017
25, 2018 at his home in Arizona
McCain was badly injured, and so was Carol, who had been in a disfiguring car accident in 1969
According to The Arizona Republic , McCain and his new wife moved to her home state of Arizona where her father's connections helped McCain launch a successful run for Congress in 1982
Carol also endorsed McCain during his 2008 presidential run and agreed to a rare interview with the ￂﾠDaily Mail to "publicize her support" for a "good man" and "close friend
As the young politician's popularity grew, the top Republicans hoping to be president in 1988 all wanted McCain's endorsement to help secure the nomination
ￂﾠ The Arizona Republic reported that "McCain and his family had vacationed at Keating's Bahamas retreat and that his wife and father-in-law in 1986 had invested nearly $360,000 in a Keating shopping-center development
The child in those campaign fliers was the McCains' adopted daughter, Bridget, who Cindy met on a 1991 relief mission in Bangladesh via Mother Teresa's nuns
"Like Dad in 1992 and Bob Dole in 1996, John McCain was on the wrong side of generational politics," Bush wrote
McCain wasn't running for president in the 2016 election, but he still managed to insert himself in the race by feuding with Republican front-runner Donald Trump during the primaries
McCain has been widely criticized for choosing Sarah Palin as his vice-presidential candidate during the 2008 election

The real story begins in December 2019 when Joanne tweeted the hashtag #IStandWithMaya, referencing Maya Forstater
In 1980 Janice Raymond authored a report to the Department of Health and Human Services repeating her arguments against transsexualism, which was cited in the 1981 decision that Medicare would not cover transition related healthcare
That decision wasn't overturned until 2014
"Troubled Blood" was published in September 2020 by Joanne Rowling under her pen name Robert Galbraith
The trope seems to originate in 1960 with Alfred Hitchcock's "Psycho"
The cross-dressing psycho trope became explicitly transphobic in the campy 1980 "Psycho" ripoff "Dressed to Kill"
So this takes us back to 2020 and "Troubled Blood"

He operated from 1719 to 1722, taking over ships off the coast of the Americas and Africa with impunity
Born in 1682 in Haverfordwest, Wales, John Roberts left home very early to join the Royal Navy
He is thought to have left at thirteen in 1695, but there is no further record of him until 1718 when he was a mate aboard a sloop
In 1719 he was made third made of a slave trading ship called the Princess for the Royal Africa Company under Captain Abraham Plumb
In late February of 1720 Roberts and his crew were joined by a French pirate named Montigny la Palisse in his sloop the Sea King
Between June of 1720 and April of 1721, Roberts took the Fortune up the coast of North America planning on looting and raiding ships along the way
The hanging of the Martinique Governor can be corroborated with public records as a Florimond Hurault de Montigny was reported to be the Governor of Martinique from 1717 to October 1720 where he is listed as deceased
Some dates list this as late as April of 1721
By late April of 1721 Roberts was sailing near the Cape Verde Islands off the coast of West Africa
He and his fleet arrived there on June 12th, 1721 and ascertained that two Royal Navy ships the HMS Swallow and the HMS Weymouth had already left in April and would return by Christmas
Roberts eventually converted the Onslow to be the fourth Royal Fortune and in November and December of 1721 the pirates decided to relax and careen their ships at the island of Annobon off the coast of Cape Lopez

Moss was drawn into the legal drama when Heard, 36, told the jury about a March 2015 fight during which she punched Depp, 58, in the face out of fear he was going to shove her sister, Whitney Henriquez, down a staircase
Decadent and volatile, their passionate romance ￢ﾀﾔ which spanned 1994 to 1997 ￢ﾀﾔ took them from London to Hollywood to Cannes, sometimes leaving chaos in their wake
The couple called it quits in 1997 after three years and a rumored engagement
Fashion writer and former Vanity Fair columnist George Wayne introduced them in 1994 at Cafe Tabac in the East Village, he posted on Instagram
Although the couple called it quits in 1997 after three years and a rumored engagement, they appeared together briefly at the Cannes Film Festival in May 1998, where Moss was reprimanded for wearing her bikini in the hallways of the legendary Hotel du Cap-Eden-Roc
I have never got that emotional over a woman before, Depp said in an interview with Hello magazine in 1998
Moss has a daughter, 19-year-old model Lila, with publisher Jefferson Hack, and she was married to The Kills musician Jamie Hince from 2011 to 2016
He wed Heard in 2015 and they divorced in 2018
In a 2020 case against the Sun, Heard (above) also talked about Moss in court

Page was the chief executive officer of Google from 1997 until August 2001 (stepping down in favor of Eric Schmidt ) then from April 2011 until July 2015 when he moved to become CEO of Alphabet Inc
(created to deliver "major advancements" as Google's parent company), [6] a post he held until December 4, 2019
[16] He received the Marconi Prize in 2004 with co-writer Brin
[28] Page was an avid reader during his youth, writing in his 2013 Google founders letter: "I remember spending a huge amount of time pouring [sic] over books and magazines"
He attended East Lansing High School , graduating in 1991
[26] Page served as the president of the Beta Epsilon chapter of the Eta Kappa Nu honor society, [32] and was a member of the 1993 "Maize & Blue" University of Michigan Solar Car team
His supervisor, Terry Winograd , encouraged him to pursue the idea, and Page recalled in 2008 that it was the best advice he had ever received
" [49] With a US$ 1-million loan from friends and family, the inaugural team moved into a Mountain View office by the start of 2000
During his first tenure as CEO, Page embarked on an attempt to fire all of Google's project managers in 2001
Under Schmidt's leadership, Google underwent a period of major growth and expansion, which included its initial public offering (IPO) on August 20, 2004
Page led the acquisition of Android for $50 million in 2005 to fulfill his ambition to place handheld computers in the possession of consumers so that they could access Google anywhere
Following a January 2011 announcement, [52] Page officially became the chief executive of Google on April 4, 2011, while Schmidt stepped down to become executive chairman
[58] [59] Jon Wiley, lead designer of Google Search at the time, codenamed Page's redesign overhaul, which officially commenced on April 4, 2011, "Project Kennedy", based on Page's use of the term "moonshots" to describe ambitious projects in a January 2013 Wired interview
Matias Duarte, senior director of the Android user experience when "Kennedy" started, explained in 2013 that "Google passionately cares about design
The eventual results of "Kennedy" which were progressively rolled out from June 2011 until January 2013, were described by The Verge technology publication as focused upon "refinement, white space, cleanliness, elasticity, usefulness, and most of all simplicity
Page also ventured into hardware and Google unveiled the Chromebook in May 2012
At the May 2013 I/O developers conference in San Francisco, Page delivered a keynote address and said "We're at maybe 1% of what is possible
Page participated in a March 2014 TedX conference that was held in Vancouver, British Columbia , Canada
Page announced a major management restructure in October 2014 so that he would no longer need to be responsible for day-to-day product-related decision making
In a November 2014 interview, Page stated that he prioritized the maintenance of his "deep knowledge" of Google's products and breadth of projects, as it had been a key motivating factor for team members
Page has not been on any press conferences since 2015 and has not presented at product launches or earnings calls since 2013
The Pedro de Lemos House was constructed between 1931 and 1941 by de Lemos
[104] Page and Southworth have two children, born in 2009 and 2011
[111] Later on, Page announced on his Google+ profile in May 2013 that his right vocal cord is paralyzed from a cold that he contracted the previous summer, while his left cord was paralyzed in 1999
[112] Page explained that he has been suffering from a vocal cord issue for 14 years, and, as of his May 2013 post, doctors were unable to identify the exact cause
In August 2021 it was revealed that Page holds a New Zealand resident's visa and had traveled to the country on a medivac flight from Fiji for his son's treatment in New Zealand, despite New Zealand promulgating an act not to allow any outsiders while facing critical moment due to worsened situation across the country due to pandemic
The flight took place on January 12, 2021
PC Magazine has praised Google as among the Top 100 Web Sites and Search Engines (1998) and awarded Google the Technical Excellence Award for Innovation in Web Application Development in 1999
Page and Brin were also Award Recipients and National Finalists for the EY Entrepreneur of the Year Award in 2003
In 2008 Page received the Communication Award from Prince Felipe at the Prince of Asturias Awards on behalf of Google

As of 2019 [update] , his films have grossed over $7
[29] DiCaprio's career prospects improved when he was cast in Parenthood , a series based on the 1989 comedy film of the same name
DiCaprio's first effort of 1995 was in Sam Raimi 's western film The Quick and the Dead , but Sony Pictures was dubious over DiCaprio's casting, and as a result, co-star Sharon Stone paid his salary herself
[50] [51] DiCaprio's next film in 1995 was The Basketball Diaries , a biopic, in which he played a teenage Jim Carroll as a drug-addicted high school basketball player and writer
The project grossed $147million worldwide, and earned DiCaprio a Silver Bear for Best Actor at the 1997 Berlin International Film Festival

The film premiered at the 2001 Berlin International Film Festival
[91] Roger Ebert praised his departure from dark and troubled characters, [89] while two Entertainment Weekly critics in 2018 called it DiCaprio's best role, labeling him "delightfully persuasive, deceptive, flirtatious, and sometimes tragic￢ﾀﾔand we dare you to find a better role, if you can"

DiCaprio continued to collaborate with Scorsese in the 2010 psychological thriller film Shutter Island , based on the 2003 novel of the same name by Dennis Lehane
DiCaprio's second role in 2010 was in Christopher Nolan 's critically acclaimed ensemble science-fiction film Inception

Martin Scorsese From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia This is the latest accepted revision , reviewed on 26 May 2022
Scorsese has received various honors including the AFI Life Achievement Award in 1997, the Kennedy Center Honor in 2007, and the BAFTA Fellowship in 2012
Scorsese received an MA from New York University 's Steinhardt School of Culture, Education, and Human Development in 1968
His 1973 crime film Mean Streets , dealing with machismo and violence, and exploring Catholic concepts of guilt and redemption, was a blueprint for his filmmaking styles
Scorsese won the Palme d'Or at Cannes with his 1976 psychological thriller Taxi Driver , which starred Robert De Niro , who became associated with Scorsese through eight more films including New York, New York (1977), Raging Bull (1980) The King of Comedy (1982), Goodfellas (1990), and Casino (1995)
An advocate for film preservation and restoration , he founded three nonprofit organizations: the Film Foundation in 1990, the World Cinema Foundation in 2007, and the African Film Heritage Project in 2017
He attended the all-boys Cardinal Hayes High School in the Bronx, graduating in 1960
in English in 1964
Film critic Roger Ebert saw the film at the 1967 Chicago International Film Festival and in his review praised Scorsese and the film, writing, "'I Call First' brings these two kinds of films together into a work that is absolutely genuine, artistically satisfying and technically comparable to the best films being made anywhere
Taxi Driver won the Palme d'Or at the 1976 Cannes Film Festival, [39] also receiving four Oscar nominations, including Best Picture
In 1977 he directed the Broadway musical The Act , starring Liza Minnelli
However, Scorsese's commitments to other projects delayed the release of the film until 1978
Along with the 1987 Michael Jackson music video " Bad ", in 1986 Scorsese made The Color of Money , a sequel to the much admired Robert Rossen film The Hustler (1961) with Paul Newman , which co-starred Tom Cruise
The Last Temptation of Christ , based on the 1955 novel written by Nikos Kazantzakis , retold the life of Christ in human rather than divine terms
In this aborted 1983 version, Aidan Quinn was cast as Jesus, and Sting was cast as Pontius Pilate
(In the 1988 version, these roles were played by Willem Dafoe and David Bowie respectively
[52] Even prior to its 1988 release, the film (adapted by Taxi Driver and Raging Bull veteran Paul Schrader) caused a massive furor, with worldwide protests against its perceived blasphemy effectively turning a low-budget independent film into a media sensation
The short also serves as a music video and was shot in the Hoyt￢ﾀﾓSchermerhorn Streets station in Brooklyn over a 6-week period during November and December 1986
The dancing and filmmaking was heavily influenced by the 1961 film West Side Story

Maher Arar ( Arabic : ￙ﾅ￘ﾧ￙ﾇ￘ﾱ ￘ﾹ￘ﾱ￘ﾧ￘ﾱ ) (born 1970) is a telecommunications engineer with dual Syrian and Canadian citizenship who has resided in Canada since 1987
Kennedy International Airport in September 2002 on his way home to Canada from a family vacation in Tunis
After the lawsuit was dismissed by the Federal District Court, the Second Circuit Court of Appeals upheld the dismissal on November 2, 2009
The Supreme Court of the United States declined to review the case on June 14, 2010
Maher Arar was born in Syria in 1970 and moved to Canada with his parents at the age of 17 in 1987 to avoid mandatory military service
Arar and Mazigh married in 1994
After he had moved back to Ottawa, Arar had a meeting with Abdullah Almalki on October 12, 2001
[18] Before Project A-O Canada was created, CSIS had been monitoring Almalki at least since 1998 with respect to his relationship with Ahmed Khadr , an Egyptian -born Canadian and alleged senior associate of Osama bin Laden
The validity of Omar Khadr's possible sighting has been seriously questioned due to the time frame of the alleged sighting which was sometime during September or October 2001
Michael Edelson stated in public testimony given during the Arar Inquiry that RCMP officials from Project AO Canada had shown pictures of Arar to Khadr in either July or August 2002 and that Khadr denied ever seeing Maher Arar
Within an affidavit , Khadr stated he was visited by three individuals claiming to be Canadians at Guantanamo Bay in March 2003
When Arar protested that he only had a casual relationship with Almalki, having once worked with Almalki's brother at an Ottawa high-tech firm, the officials produced a copy of Arar's 1997 rental lease which Almalki had co-signed
Arar received a PhD in electrical engineering from the University of Ottawa in 2010
Arar, Monia Mazigh and their family in 2002 and 2003" [48] and announced that Arar would receive C$10
Stockwell Day was invited to look at the evidence in the United States' possession in January 2007
[83] A redacted addendum to the initial DHS OIG report was released in March 2010
The new standard took effect on October 1, 2009
Time magazine chose Arar as Canadian Newsmaker of the Year for 2004
[99] Arar, along with Sergeant Patrick Tower, was chosen a co-Nation Builder by The Globe and Mail for 2006
Jimmy Carter , former President of the United States, discusses Arar sympathetically in his bestselling 2005 book Our Endangered Values: America's Moral Crisis ( ISBN 978-0-7432-8501-8 )
, and her brother David Goodman wrote about Arar in their 2006 book, Static ( ISBN 978-1-4013-0914-5 )
In January 2010 Maher Arar began publishing the online magazine PRISM
Arar announced the magazine's closure on January 8, 2013
[113] The report recommends the initiation of a criminal investigation into the US government's detention practices and interrogation methods since September 11, 2001 and the fulfillment of the US obligation under the Convention against Torture to ensure that victims of torture obtain redress
As the tenth anniversary of September 11, 2001 approached, several reflections have talked about the case of Maher Arar

Nancy Pelosi began her political career as a volunteer and gradually moved up the ranks, making the leap to public office in a special election for California&apos;s Eighth District in 1987
, in 1962
Pelosi rose up in the party ranks, serving as a California representative to the Democratic National Committee from 1976 to 1996

Pelosi found herself at the center of a controversy in 2009 when the CIA asserted that she had been made aware of its use of waterboarding of terrorism suspects&#x2014;a technique that Pelosi had vocally opposed
Ohio Congressman Tim Ryan sought to replace her as minority leader in 2016 but was unsuccessful
Taking advantage of the "magic-minute rule," which allows House leaders to talk for as long as they want, Pelosi read testimonies from Dreamers and recited Bible passages, in all standing for some eight hours and seven minutes, a House record dating back to at least 1909
After Democrats reclaimed control of the House in the 2018 midterms, Pelosi was once again elected House speaker at the beginning of 2019, placing her on the front line in the battle with President Donald Trump over his demand for $5
The tipping point came with reports that Trump had withheld military aid to Ukraine to pressure its government into investigating the actions of 2020 presidential candidate Joe Biden &apos;s son
The speaker then delayed the process of relaying the articles to the Senate, in hopes of securing terms for a fair trial in the Republican-controlled upper chamber, before finally following through on January 15, 2020

When Steven Spielberg , Francis Ford Coppola , and George Lucas were revealed to be the presenters for Best Director at the 2007 Academy Awards, it seemed like a foregone conclusion that Martin Scorsese would finally win an Oscar for " The Departed
That distinction goes to his friend Brian De Palma, who directed De Niro in 1968's "Greetings" (about a man trying to avoid being drafted into the Vietnam War) and its 1970 sequel "Hi, Mom
"Leo has given me a few projects, I've given him a few projects and, again, with Leo, there's that trust," Scorsese toldￂﾠ The Hollywood Reporter ￂﾠin 2013
The 2019 film "Joker" is one of the most successful comic book films ever made, and its Scorsese-esque aesthetic was instrumental in its appeal
"I thought about it a lot over the last four years and decided I did not have the time for it,"ￂﾠScorsese explained in a 2019 interview with theￂﾠ BBC
At the time, Spielberg was supposed to direct a remake of the 1962 film "Cape Fear," so he convinced Scorsese to swap
That 1974 film centered on a widow trying to find a better life for herself and her son, and it earned Ellen Burstyn an Academy Award for Best Actress and Diane Ladd a nomination for Best Supporting Actress
Martin Scorsese's 1988 film "The Last Temptation of Christ" was highly controversial for its sequence where Jesus Christ imagines a life where he doesn't sacrifice himself and instead settles down with Mary Magdalene
Through the years, he kept putting it off and making other films until the Italian distributer Cecchi Gori Pictures sued him in 2012 for breach of contract and Scorsese finally decided that "Silence" would have to be his next film
"One of the things that steered me in the direction of visual storytelling was the fact that I come from a working-class family [and] I was a sickly child,"ￂﾠhe recalled while speaking with the Film Foundation ￂﾠin 2006
"There was some violence, and the aftermath of it was they have to stop off at Joe Pesci's house, his mother's house, to pick up a shovel so they can bury the guy,"ￂﾠScorsese explained of the scene while appearing (virtually) at the TCM Film Festival ￂﾠin 2021
Scorsese's 1967 debut film "Who's That Knocking at My Door" may not be his greatest work, but it showed enough promise for the late critic Roger Ebert to take note
Ebert would become one of Scorsese's greatest champions over the decades that followed, and went so far as to predict in his original 1969 review , "It is possible that with more experience and maturity Scorsese will direct more polished, finished films ￢ﾀﾔ but this work, completed when he was 25, contains a frankness he may have diluted by then

Omar al-Bashir , in full Omar Hassan Ahmad al-Bashir , (born January 7, 1944, Hosh Wad Banaqa, Sudan), Sudanese military officer who led a revolt that overthrew the elected government of Sudan in 1989
He served as president of Sudan from 1993 until 2019, when he was ousted in a military coup
He studied at a military college in Cairo and fought in 1973 with the Egyptian army against Israel
Bashir, frustrated with the country￢ﾀﾙs leadership, led a successful coup in 1989
Together they began to Islamize the country, and in March 1991 Islamic law ( Sharￄﾫￊ﾿ah ) was introduced
In October 1993 the Revolutionary Council was disbanded, and Bashir was appointed president of Sudan; he retained military rule , however
He was confirmed as president by an election held in 1996
After the December 2000 elections in which he was once again confirmed as president, he dismissed the cabinet
Under international pressure, Bashir agreed in 2005 to form a peace pact with the SPLA
The AU peacekeeping mission was eventually replaced by a joint UN-AU mission that began deployment in 2008

On March 4, 2009, the ICC issued an arrest warrant for Bashir￢ﾀﾔthe first time that the ICC sought the arrest of a sitting head of state￢ﾀﾔcharging him with war crimes and crimes against humanity but not with genocide; in July 2010 the ICC issued a second arrest warrant, this time charging Bashir with genocide
Meanwhile, in January 2010 Bashir retired from his post as commander of the armed forces, a position that he had held since the 1989 coup
Under the terms of the 2005 agreement with the southern rebels, a referendum for southern Sudanese citizens was held in January 2011 to determine whether the south would remain part of Sudan or secede
The results overwhelmingly indicated a preference to secede, which occurred on July 9, 2011
As the 2015 elections approached, Bashir once again was the NCP￢ﾀﾙs presidential candidate
Bashir faced an unprecedented level of popular unrest that began in December 2018 and continued into the following year
Bashir also faced charges for his role in the 1989 coup that brought him to power; that trial began in July 2020

When he returned to Sudan as a colonel in the Sudanese Army , al-Bashir led a group of army officers in ousting the unstable coalition government of Prime Minister Sadiq al-Mahdi in a bloodless military coup on 30 June 1989

Intelligence officials believe bin Laden was responsible for many deadly acts of terrorism, including the 1998 bombings of the U
Embassies in Kenya and Tanzania and the September 11, 2001 attacks on the Pentagon and the World Trade Center
Osama bin Laden was born in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia in 1957 or 1958
They took away his passport and spurned his offer to send &#x201C;Afghan Arabs&#x201D; to guard the border after Iraq invaded Kuwait in 1990
For example, they trained and armed the Somali rebels who killed 18 American servicemen in Mogadishu in 1993
They were also linked to the 1993 bombing of New York&#x2019;s World Trade Center ; the attempted assassination of Egyptian president Hosni Mubarek in 1995; the bombing of a U
National Guard training center in Riyadh that same year; and the truck bomb that destroyed the Khobar Towers, an American military residence in Dharan, in 1996
In an attempt to protect himself from arrest and win even more recruits to al Qaeda&#x2019;s deadly cause, bin Laden moved from Sudan to Afghanistan in 1996
Meanwhile, al Qaeda operatives were busy planning the biggest attack of all: the September 11, 2001 attacks on the World Trade Center and the Pentagon

While studying at college, Sanger developed an interest in using the Internet for educational purposes and joined the online encyclopedia Nupedia as editor-in-chief in 2000
Disappointed with the slow progress of Nupedia, Sanger proposed using a wiki to solicit and receive articles to put through Nupedia's peer-review process; this change led to the development and launch of Wikipedia in 2001
Sanger served as Wikipedia's community leader in Wikipedia's early stages but became increasingly disillusioned with the project and left it in 2002
Since Sanger's departure from Wikipedia, he has been critical of the project, describing it in 2007 as being "broken beyond repair"
[4] [5] He founded Citizendium in 2006 to compete with Wikipedia, but stepped down as editor-in-chief in 2010, and left Citizendium entirely in 2020
In 2017, he joined Everipedia as chief information officer (CTO), but resigned from this position in 2019 to establish the Knowledge Standards Foundation and the encyclosphere

Sanger received a Bachelor of Arts degree in philosophy from Reed in 1991, a Master of Arts from Ohio State University in 1995, and a Doctor of Philosophy from Ohio State University in 2000
[15] Beginning in 1998, he and a friend ran a website called "Sanger and Shannon's Review of Y2K News Reports", a resource for people such as managers of computer systems who were concerned about the year 2000 problem
" [14] In January 2001, Sanger proposed the creation of a wiki to speed article development, [24] which resulted in the launch of Wikipedia on January 15, 2001
Sanger attempted to revive Nupedia throughout 2002 as its activity petered out
[39] Nupedia's server crashed in September 2003 and the site was never relaunched
[46] As early as January 17, 2001, Sanger was cited as "Instigator of Nupedia's wiki" by its chief copyeditor Ruth Ifcher, [47] and he was identified as a co-founder of Wikipedia by September 2001
In a November 2015 interview with Zachary Schwartz for Vice , Sanger expanded on his experiences with trolls on Wikipedia during the site's initial growth: "It was kind of stressful
In a November 2016 interview with Alexandre Gilbert for The Times of Israel , Sanger said that Wikipedia has "a problem with fairness and sound governance
In a July 2010 interview with Kathryn Schulz from Slate , Sanger said: "If you're talking about political biases, I actually think that that's one of Wikipedia's least-worst problems
In a May 2019 interview with Sophie Foggin from 150Sec , regarding the website's neutrality, Sanger said: "Wikipedia has long since decided to turn the other cheek when influential editors make articles speak with one point of view, when they dismiss unpopular views, or when they utterly fail to do justice to alternative approaches to a topic
In a February 2021 interview with Fox News , Sanger stated that the site's "ideological and religious bias is real and troubling, particularly in a resource that continues to be treated by many as an unbiased reference work"
In a July 2021 interview with LockdownTV , Sanger claimed that Wikipedia is not trustworthy and that its contributors have a left-leaning bias
It took nearly a decade following the September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks on New York City and Washington, D
" [62] In a July 22, 2021 interview with Tucker Carlson , Sanger said that Wikipedia allowing anonymous contributors had resulted in the website being taken over by criminal bodies, as well as by corporations and governments
In an August 2021 interview with The Sunday Times of London, Sanger objected to Wikipedia's description of alternative medicines , such as homeopathy , as " pseudoscience "
In a March 2022 interview with Fox Nation , Sanger once more said that Wikipedia had abandoned its neutrality policy and that "the kinds of people that are allowed to have any influence on Wikipedia have been narrowed down greatly to essentially people who agree with the establishment left"
He studied at a Nigerian Anglican Seminary and was ordained a deacon in 1978 and a priest in 1979 in the Anglican Church of Nigeria
Soon after ordination, he moved to the United States to study at the Virginia Theological Seminary , where he graduated in 1981 with a master's degree

Sanger predicted a rapid increase in Citizendium's traffic at its first anniversary in 2007
Sanger, who in early 2007 announced he did not intend to head Citizendium indefinitely, [73] effectively ceased to edit it in early 2009, although an announcement confirming this was not made until July 30, 2009, on the Citizendium-l mailing list
[85] He was a key organizer of the Digital Universe Encyclopedia web project that was launched in early 2006
[11] However, in 2007 TIME magazine suggested [12] that he "has some explaining to do" in relation to his support for legislation [13] criminalising "gay
[91] Sanger headed the development of WatchKnowLearn from 2008 to 2010
" [14] But he has been criticised by other sections of the international press, including the right-leaning Daily Telegraph which in an editorial on 23 March 2007 characterised him as one of the "extremists" who had "hijacked" conservative Anglicanism, and as "a deeply divisive figure" who has "defended new Nigerian legislation that makes "cancerous" (his word) same-sex activity punishable by up to five years' imprisonment
[94] In 2010 and 2011, he continued developing a web-based reading-tutorial application for beginning readers, which was launched as Reading Bear in 2012
[96] The site, which aimed to be a crowdsourced news aggregator , went online in December 2014 [97] but ran out of money in July 2015

Burton died in 1983 and was succeeded by his wife, Sala, who, shortly before her death in 1987, urged Pelosi to run for the seat
She narrowly won a special election and was reelected in 1988 to a full term
Pelosi developed a reputation as a shrewd politician, and she steadily rose within the party, becoming minority whip in 2002
He studied at a Nigerian Anglican seminary and was ordained a deacon in 1978 and a priest in 1979 in the Anglican Church of Nigeria
In 1989 he was ordained bishop of Abuja and in 1997 archbishop of Province III of the Church of Nigeria, consisting of the northern dioceses of Nigeria
In 2002, he became Archbishop of the Abuja Province, a position he held until 2010
He succeeded Akinola on 25 March 2010
Soon after ordination, he moved to the United States to study at the Virginia Theological Seminary, where he graduated in 1981 with a Master Degree
Akinola was given the National Award of Commander of the Order of the Niger (CON) in December 2003

After Democrat Barack Obama assumed the presidency in 2009, Pelosi was a vocal supporter of many of his policies, helping to shepherd through his $787 billion stimulus package in February 2009 and playing an instrumental role in the more-than-yearlong effort to secure health care reform, which ultimately passed in March 2010

In the lead-up to the 2010 midterm elections, she became a target of Republican attacks and a rallying point for Tea Partiers , who were keen to turn the elections into a referendum on the Democratic agenda
Their lackluster electoral performance, especially with working-class voters, lead to unrest among House Democrats, and, after Republican Donald Trump was elected president in 2016 , Tim Ryan from Ohio challenged Pelosi for minority leader
The 2018 midterm elections saw a massive resurgence for the Democrats as they regained control of the House
These escalated in March 2019 when special counsel Robert Mueller concluded his investigation into allegations of Russian interference in the 2016 election
Pelosi was initially reluctant to move on impeachment, but in September 2019 it was publicly revealed that a whistle-blower had filed a complaint alleging that Trump had withheld aid to Ukraine in order to pressure the country into opening a corruption investigation into Joe Biden , a political rival
In February 2020 the Senate acquitted Trump

Being the intellectual author of the attacks of September 11, 2001 and founding the terrorist network Al-Qaeda
It subsequently became the subject of international persecution for a whole decade, from 2001 to 2011
He was also responsible for other terrorist attacks against the United States and other Western powers, including the attacks on the United States embassies in Kenya and Tanzania on August 7, 1998
on Sunday, May 1, 2011 (Washington DC time; in Pakistan and other parts of the world it was already May 2), the President of the United States Barack Obama officially announced the death of Bin Laden, after a military operation carried out by US commandos in a residence on the outskirts of Abbottabad, Pakistan
From 1968 to 1976 he attended an elite secular school called Al-Thager
In 1980 he began recruiting guerrillas and established his first camps
Trained by the CIA, he learned how to move money through shell companies and tax havens; to prepare explosives; to use encrypted codes to communicate; At that time, the United States collaborated unconditionally with Afghan groups, due to its participation in the war against the USSR (between 1979 and 1989 the Americans gave about three billion dollars to the Afghan resistance, which favored to Bin Laden)
Despite this progressive departure in the 1990s from the positions of the Saudi government and its Western allies, even in 1993 the British press described Bin Laden as an anti-Soviet warrior who sets his army on the road to peace
Osama bin Laden with Pakistani journalist Hamid Mir in an interview he gave in Kabul in 1997
Between August 1988 and the end of 1989 he created a terrorist network known as al Qaeda (Arabic: ￘ﾧ￙ﾄ￙ﾂ￘ﾧ￘ﾹ￘ﾯ￘ﾩ al-qￄﾁ`ida, the Base), which consisted largely of Muslim militants that Bin Laden had known in Afghanistan, such as his lieutenant Aymￃﾡn al-Zawahiri, along with Bin Laden himself
In 1994, after the Saudi government confiscated his passport after accusing him of subversion, Bin Laden fled to Sudan, where he is accused of having organized terrorist training camps and from where he was finally expelled in 1996
Between 1996 and 1998, Bin Laden issued a series of fatwas (Arabic: religious decrees) declaring a holy war against the United States, which he accused, among other things, of plundering the natural resources of the Muslim world and helping and incite the enemies of Islam

The US authorities blamed him for the preparation and financing of the attack after the claim made by Bin Laden himself, although the mastermind was a Pakistani Islamic radical named Khalid Sheikh Mohammed, information that was corroborated in 2006
Journalist Ed Haas (editor and writer of the Muckraker Report) contacted FBI headquarters on this matter on June 5, 2006
Bin Laden appears in a new video in 2007 and according to members of the United States intelligence service they assure that the tape is genuine and that the voice emanating from the video belongs to the leader of al-Qaeda
On January 31, 2010, the Spanish newspaper El Paￃﾭs and the Colombian newspaper El Tiempo, presented an interview with Sultan Tarar, right hand man of the fugitive Taliban Mullah Omar, in which he affirmed that Bin Laden died of kidney cancer between May and June 2002
However, on March 25, 2010 Osama bin Laden appears and sends a warning to the United States Government through an audio broadcast by the Qatari television network Al Jazeera, Bin Laden said that the day that the United States seizes In the decision to execute Khalid Sheikh Mohamed, the alleged mastermind of these attacks, Al Qaeda will execute all the Americans in its power
His third wife Khairiah Sabar, with one son, would not survive the 2001 Afghanistan bombings
Her African lover between 1996 and 1998, Kola Boof, confessed that he raped her on some occasions and even kidnapped her for ten months in a Moroccan hotel
His third wife, Khairiah, apparently did not die in 2001, but fled to Iran, where he was left under house arrest, and then he was reunited with Bin Laden in Pakistan in 2011
On the other hand, in January 2010 the FBI released virtual images of Osama bin Laden, in which it projected what the Al Qaeda leader would look like at that time
It was reported that Osama bin Laden was killed during a US military action on May 1, 2011
In relation to the above, they have suggested that his murder could be a hoax by the United States Government, since, according to the data they handle, he could have died a long time before, even in December 2001
Among the various conspiratorial versions is that of the journalist Seymour Hersh, who thinks that the Pakistani ISI had been holding Bin Laden since 2006 and that after his death, caused by US soldiers led by Pakistani spies, his body was not thrown into the ocean

[19] The resulting Abbottabad Commission Report , which revealed Pakistani state military and intelligence authorities' "collective failure" that enabled bin Laden to hide in Pakistan for nine years, was leaked to Al Jazeera on July 8, 2013
[21] One of those claims came from Mohammed al-Qahtani , a detainee interrogated for 48 days more or less continuously between November 23, 2002, and January 11, 2003
official, in 2004 a prisoner named Hassan Ghul revealed that bin Laden relied on a trusted courier known as al-Kuwaiti
[24] Abu Faraj al-Libbi was captured in 2005 and transferred to Guantￃﾡnamo in September 2006
[24] Pakistani officials in 2011 stated the courier's name was Ibrahim Saeed Ahmed, from Pakistan's Swat Valley
A 2010 wiretap of another suspect picked up a conversation with al-Kuwaiti
CIA paramilitary operatives located al-Kuwaiti in August 2010 and followed him back to the Abbottabad compound, which led them to speculate it was bin Laden's location
[35] Google Earth maps made from satellite photographs show that the compound was not present in 2001 but had been built by the time that new images were taken in 2005
[37] Following the American raid and killing of bin Laden, the Pakistani government demolished the compound in February 2012
An article published in Political Science Quarterly in 2016 surveyed various published accounts and interpretations of the objective of the mission and concluded that "the capture option was mainly there for appearance's sake and to fulfill requirements of international law and that everyone involved considered it for all practical purposes a mission to kill
McRaven , the commander of the Joint Special Operations Command (JSOC), about the compound in January 2011
[94] An intelligence official told Seymour Hersh in 2015 that no firefight took place
What the transfer really did was ensure that the files would be placed in the CIA's operational records, a records system that￢ﾀﾔdue to the 1986 CIA Operational Files exemption￢ﾀﾔis not subject to the FOIA and is a black hole for anyone trying to access the files within
Following the attacks of September 11, 2001 , the U
State Department , said in 2010 that "under domestic law, the use of lawful weapons systems￢ﾀﾔconsistent with the applicable laws of war￢ﾀﾔfor precision targeting of specific high-level belligerent leaders when acting in self-defense or during an armed conflict is not unlawful, and hence does not constitute 'assassination'
David Scheffer , director of the Northwestern University School of Law Center for International Human Rights, said the fact that bin Laden had previously been indicted in 1998 in the U

The Pakistani government denied that it had sheltered bin Laden, and said it had shared information with the CIA and other intelligence agencies about the compound since 2009
Carlotta Gall , in her 2014 book The Wrong Enemy: America in Afghanistan, 2001￢ﾀﾓ2014 , accuses the ISI , Pakistan's clandestine intelligence service, of hiding and protecting Osama bin Laden and his family after the September 11, 2001 attacks
[274] Pakistan Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI) raided the house in December 2003 but did not find him
[275] This account was contradicted by American officials who said that satellite photos show that in 2004 the site was an empty field

According to Steve Coll , as of 2019 there is no direct evidence showing Pakistani knowledge of bin Laden's presence in Abbottabad, even by a rogue or compartmented faction within the government, other than the circumstantial fact of bin Laden's compound being located near (albeit not directly visible from) the Pakistan Military Academy
Coll notes that a Pakistani Taliban cell had previously surveilled the army's General Headquarters in Rawalpindi out of a nearby house for two months prior to a deadly October 2009 attack on the facility￢ﾀﾔwithout detection
We first learned about the facilitator/courier's nom de guerre from a detainee not in CIA custody in 2002
Bin Laden's youngest wife told Pakistani investigators that the family lived in the feudal village of Chak Shah Muhammad , in the nearby district of Haripur , Pakistan, for two and a half years before moving to Abbottabad in late 2005
Seventeen documents seized during the Abbottabad raid, consisting of electronic letters or draft letters dating from September 2006 to April 2011, were released by the Combating Terrorism Center at West Point one year and one day after bin Laden's death
in the wake of the 2009 Christmas Day bomb plot by writing "We need to extend and develop our operations in America and not keep it limited to blowing up airplanes
The United States Department of Justice released a further eleven documents in March 2015
[327] The documents were part of the trial against Abid Naseer, who was convicted of plotting to bomb a Manchester shopping mall in 2009
Serial numbers found at the scene were consistent with an MH-60 built in 2009
Barisha raid , similar raid that targeted Islamic State leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi in 2019

In 1971 Scorsese moved to Hollywood, where he hung out with some of the most promising young directors around: Brian De Palma, Steven Spielberg, and Francis Ford Coppola
In 1976 he made the first of his most enduring films, Taxi Driver , a disturbing character study of Robert De Niro￢ﾀﾙs antiheroic Travis Bickle, a war veteran and loner whose reaction to the moral malaise of New York City turns increasingly psychotic
In 1983 he made the artfully dark send-up of celebrity culture, The King of Comedy , in which Robert De Niro and Sandra Bernhard stalk and kidnap a Johnny Carson-type comedian and talk show host played by Jerry Lewis
There was in the next decade a sequel and a remake: The Color of Money boldly followed The Hustler, a beloved classic, 30 years after the original; and with De Niro in 1991, Scorsese remade Cape Fear , the 1962 thriller that had starred Robert Mitchum
In 1985 Scorsese made the offbeat cult classic After Hours , in which a computer dork played by Griffin Dunne pursues the bohemian Rosanna Arquette and ends up in a series of bizarre misadventures downtown
Also in 1990 Scorsese established the Film Foundation, which supports preservation and restoration projects at leading film archives
In 1993 he directed The Age of Innocence , based on Edith Wharton￢ﾀﾙs scathing novel of manners
￢ﾀﾜI saw these movies,￢ﾀﾝ Scorsese says, straightforwardly as ever, in his 1999 My Voyage to Italy
Scorsese has pointed out that Raging Bull comes out of On the Waterfront and Abraham Polonsky￢ﾀﾙs Body and Soul ; that the way the soundtrack works in Goodfellas was inspired by the synthesis of music and image in Michael Powell￢ﾀﾙs Tales of Hoffman ; that Taxi Driver contains telltale traces of Michelangelo Antonioni, Jean-Luc Godard￢ﾀﾙs Two or Three Things I Know About Her , and, ever the cultural democrat, a 1949 John Payne western called El Paso
Scorsese￢ﾀﾙs impulse to return to and repurpose the images that had left a mark on him was evident from the get-go: In his 1973 Mean Streets , small-time gangsters escape Little Italy for Monument Valley at a showing of John Ford￢ﾀﾙs The Searchers
For Scorsese, the key to this transition from moviegoer to budding movie scholar was the extensively illustrated 1949 edition of A Pictorial History of the Movies by Deems Taylor, which Scorsese compulsively checked out from the Tompkins Square Library as a young man, finally returning it with a few stills suspiciously snipped out
The director confesses to his sin in A Personal Journey with Martin Scorsese through American Movies , a three-part 1995 documentary produced by the British Film Institute, which has Scorsese breathlessly narrating the story of our national film history
If you were from a previous generation, you might have, in the same way, referred to Scorsese￢ﾀﾙs answers in the now-defunct ￢ﾀﾜGuilty Pleasures￢ﾀﾝ feature from a 1978 Film Comment , in which he told of his passion for Howard Hawks￢ﾀﾙs little-loved Land of the Pharaohs
This move into public advocacy led to Scorsese￢ﾀﾙs crucial role in the 1990 creation of the Film Foundation, a nonprofit dedicated to funding preservation projects, directly responsible for restoring more than five hundred titles to date
While the Film Foundation has principally focused on American film, Scorsese￢ﾀﾙs chairmanship of the newly created World Cinema Foundation in 2007 widened his purview to preservation in developing countries
In a 2000 Esquire piece asking critics to name ￢ﾀﾜthe next Scorsese,￢ﾀﾝ Scorsese himself prophetically voted for Wes Anderson
That scene was from a picture called The Magic Box, which was made in England in 1950
And actually you can go back to a man named Louis Le Prince who shot a little home movie in 1888
[film clip: 1895 film of train arriving in station by Lumiￃﾨre Brothers] ￂﾠￂﾠThis film, by the Lumiￃﾨre Brothers in France, is commonly recognized as the first publicly projected film
It was shot in 1895
When you watch it, it really is 1895
Porter￢ﾀﾙs 1903 milestone film The Great Train Robbery
Griffith made in 1912 ￢ﾀﾓ it￢ﾀﾙs a remarkable film called The Musketeers of Pig Alley
But he goes further with the idea of the cut, he shifts between four different stories ￢ﾀﾓ the first story is the massacre of the Hugenots, the second story is the passion of Christ, the third is a spectacle really, the fall of Babylon, and a fourth story which was a modern American story set in 1916
[film clip: The Day the Earth Stood Still , by Robert Wise] ￂﾠWe￢ﾀﾙve created three study units around certain titles, one of which is a 1951 film called The Day the Earth Stood Still
For me, 1951 was my present when I saw it
ￂﾠ In 1950 it was replaced with safety stock
Every time a silent picture by some miracle turns up like John Ford￢ﾀﾙs film he made in 1927 called Upstream, which was recently discovered by the National Film Preservation Foundation in an archive in New Zealand ￢ﾀﾓ every time one of those shows up we have to remind ourselves that there are hundreds, maybe thousands more that are gone forever

This was in 1973
It was released in 1941 with a lot of fanfare, and while it wasn￢ﾀﾙt a great financial success, it was generally regarded as a milestone in the art of cinema, re-discovered in the 50s by my generation, on television actually, and considered one of the greatest films ever made

Den 1 maj 2011 lokal tid meddelade USA:s president Barack Obama i ett direktsￃﾤnt TV-tal att bin Ladin dￃﾶdats av ett amerikanskt Navy SEAL-specialfￃﾶrband i ett hus belￃﾤget cirka sex mil norr om Pakistans huvudstad Islamabad
[ 27 ] Muhammed bin Ladin dog i en flygkrasch 1967
Han studerade sedan till ingenjￃﾶr vid King Abdul Aziz University mellan ￃﾥren 1976 och 1979
Han avlade en examen i ekonomi och fￃﾶrvaltning 1981
Usama bin Ladin var redan 1979 pￃﾥ plats i Afghanistan efter den sovjetiska invasionen och organiserade frivilliga araber och andra islamister som kom till Afghanistan fￃﾶr att slￃﾥss mot Sovjetunionen
bin Ladin ￃﾥtervￃﾤnde till Saudiarabien 1990 som hjￃﾤlte
Efter Afghanistankrigets slut 1992 lￃﾤmnade han landet i avsky ￃﾶver de inbￃﾶrdes stridigheter som brￃﾶt ut i Afghanistan
1996 lￃﾤmnade han Sudan fￃﾶr att ￃﾥterigen bege sig till Afghanistan och Jalalabad dￃﾤr talibanerna nyligen tagit makten
" [ 52 ] I mitten av 1997 hotade Norra alliansen att storma Jalalabad, vilket tvingade bin Ladin att ￃﾶverge sin fￃﾶrlￃﾤggning och flytta verksamheten till Tarnakgￃﾥrdarna i sￃﾶder
1999 avslￃﾶjades det ￃﾤven att Usama bin Ladin och hans tunisiska assistent Mehrez Aodouni ￃﾥr 1993 hade beviljats medborgarskap och bosniska pass av regeringen i Sarajevo
[ 57 ] Under 2000 var bin Ladin verksam frￃﾥn Kosovo och planerade en del av terrorattentaten under Konflikten i Preￅﾡevodalen
[ 59 ] Enligt FN:s sￃﾤkerhetsrￃﾥds resolution 1333 av den 19 december 2000 blev alla medlemsstater skyldiga att utan drￃﾶjsmￃﾥl spￃﾤrra fonder och andra finansiella tillgￃﾥngar som tillhￃﾶr Usama bin Ladin och individer och organisationer som ￃﾤr kopplade till honom eller till al-Qaida
Namnlistan har kompletterats vid ￃﾥtskilliga tillfￃﾤllen och genom en ￃﾤndring den 9 november 2001 kom bland annat tre svenska personer att fￃﾶras upp pￃﾥ listan
[ 69 ] I ett videoband som ￃﾥterfanns av amerikanska styrkor i november 2001 i Jalalabad sￃﾥgs dock bin Ladin diskutera attackerna med Khaled al-Harbi pￃﾥ ett sￃﾤtt som indikerade fￃﾶrhandskￃﾤnnedom
[ 70 ] I ett videoband frￃﾥn 2004 ￃﾶvergav bin Ladin sina fￃﾶrnekanden utan att ta tillbaka nￃﾥgra tidigare uttalanden
Ett exempel pￃﾥ ett av dessa rykten ￃﾤr en obekrￃﾤftad rapport i den franska tidningen L'est Republicain enligt vilken bin Ladin ska ha avlidit den 23 augusti 2006 i tyfoidfeber
[ 12 ] bin Ladin var dock inte efterlyst av FBI fￃﾶr 11 september-attackerna utan fￃﾶr bombningarna av tvￃﾥ av USA:s ambassader i Afrika 1998
I januari 2009 meddelade bin Ladin att han kommer att prￃﾶva president Barack Obamas administration och eventuellt planera en ny terroristattack
[ 82 ] Den 14 januari 2009 publicerades en ny ljudupptagning, enligt uppgift med bin Ladin, pￃﾥ islamistiska hemsidor som manade fￃﾶr jihad mot den israeliska offensiven i Gaza
Den 7 juni 2010 rapporterade tidningen Kuwaiti Al Siyassa att bin Ladin gￃﾶmmer sig i bergsstaden Savzevar i nordￃﾶstra Iran
[ 88 ] Den australiensiska tidningen The Australian publicerade pￃﾥstￃﾥendet den 9 juni 2010

In 1979 the rulers of Africas largest state, seeking to overcome North-South, Muslim-Christian, desert-rain forest differences, began moving the capital from crowded, coastal Lagos to the sparsely settled interior
His presentation sermon on March 25, 2000 at the Cathedral Church of the Advent carefully laid out his future program, although no one listening that Saturday morning would have predicted the controversy he would ignite for his unyielding opposition to homosexuality, his active support for irregularly ordained bishops and breakaway parishes in America, and for his sustained criticisms of the Archbishop of Canterbury and presiding bishops of the Episcopal Church in the USA
In February 2006 Muslim-Christian riots once more broke out in Nigeria
In a personal conversation during our March 2000 meeting, I asked him if a Christian-Muslim dialogue was possible
10 of 1998 that included provisions to encourage greater understanding of various expressions of human sexuality
By 1968 he had moved from a job as a postal worker to becoming a skilled carpenter and cabinetmaker, with his own shop and showroom, and several employees
Suleja was an isolated truckers stop, a crossroads on the North-South road when Peter was assigned there in 1978
In 1979 Peter left Suleja for three years at Virginia Theological Seminary
He stayed in Suleja from 1981 to 1984, and then became Provincial Missionary from 1984 to1989
By 1985 twenty-eight Anglican churches had been built in the new capital
In November 1989 Peter became bishop of Nigerias twenty-sixth diocese
Nigerias population, divided into over two hundred and fifty ethnic groups, was estimated at 135 million persons in 2007
) The Nigerian bishops are all for them, Archbishop Peter Akinola told me on March 31, 2000
Over the next seven years Archbishop Akinolas actions proved far more disruptive than his inaugural sermon remarks in 2000 suggested, and he appeared unconcerned about the controversy they caused, and growing antipathy toward him
On June 19, 2007 he was voted out (72 to 33) of the presidency of the Christian Association of Nigeria, an umbrella group representing over fifty million members and composed of representatives of most Christian bodies in Nigeria
He had pointedly refused to take communion at primates meetings in Ireland in 2005 and Tanzania in 2007 with the heads of the Episcopal Church in America
In 2005 he sent an inflammatory letter from a group of porous membership called Global South
During August 2007 Akinola also issued a lengthy pastoral letter, large sections of it apparently written by Minns, called A Most Agonizing Journey Towards Lambeth 2008
It has been costly and debilitating for all concerned as most recently demonstrated by the tepid response to the invitations to the proposed Lambeth Conference 2008
We made a deliberate, prayerful decision in 1998 with regard to matters of Human Sexuality
The journey started in February 1997 in Kuala Lumpur
We have made enormous efforts since 1997 in seeking to avoid this crisis, but without success
In 2001, the Primates meeting in Kanuga, North Carolina issued a pastoral letter acknowledging estrangement in the Church due to changes in theology and practice regarding human sexuality, and calling on all provinces of the Communion to avoid actions that might damage the credibility of mission in the world In April, 2002 meeting at Canterbury the Primates further issued a pastoral letter recognizing responsibility of all bishops to articulate the fundamentals of faith and maintain the Church truth
In what appeared to be deliberate defiance the Diocese of New Westminster in Canada voted in June 2002 to approve the blessings of same-sex unions with the enthusiastic support of their Bishop Michael Ingham
Later that year ACC-12 meeting in Hong Kong in October 2002 approved a resolution urging dioceses and bishops to refrain from unilateral actions and policies that would strain communion
The following year ECUSA met in General Convention in Minneapolis in July/August 2003
The Primates meeting at Lambeth Palace in October 2003 issued a pastoral statement condemning ECUSAs decisions at General Convention describing them as actions that threaten the unity of our own Communion as well as our relationships with other parts of Christs Church, our mission and witness, and our relations with other faiths, in a world already confused in areas of sexuality, morality and theology and polarized Christian opinion
During 2004 there was a growing number of so-called blessings of same-sex unions by American and Canadian priests even though the Windsor Report released in September 2004 reaffirmed
Although the Primates in February 2005 at their meeting in Dromantine, Northern Ireland, advised the withdrawal of both ECUSA and the ACoC from the ACC the continued influence of these churches on the Communion and their renewed efforts to make others adopt their intransigent line frustrated any genuine reconciliation attempts
The failure of resolve by the Archbishop of Canterbury and the unwillingness of the other Instruments of Unity to effect discipline on those who had rejected the mind of the Communion prompted the Church of Nigeria to effect a change in her constitution during a General Synod held in Onitsha in September 2005
The Third Anglican South-to-South Encounter in Egypt October 2005 issued a very strong indictment of ECUSA and the ACoC and called for a common Anglican Covenant among churches remaining true to Biblical Christianity and historic Anglicanism
Ignoring all the calls for repentance, homosexual unions and nominations for episcopacy continued in the USA with the Archbishop of Canterbury expressing deep unease with such nominations in California in February 2006
A much-awaited ECUSA General Convention in 2006 proved to be a disappointment as resolutions expressing regret for the harm done to the communion were rejected as well as one that tried to emphasize the necessity of Christ for salvation
Nigeria needed no further prodding to proceed with the election in June 2006 and the August 2006 consecration of the Rt
The Nigerian House of Bishops also declared a reluctance to participate in the 2008 Lambeth Conference with an unrepentant ECUSA and Canada
The Anglican Communion Primates meeting in Dar es Salaam in February 2007 reaffirmed the 1998 Lambeth resolution and called on ECUSA (now TEC) to consider definite actions, which could heal the communion as well as reassure those who have been alienated of adequate pastoral care
His church has broken communion with the Episcopal Church of the US over the ordination in 2003 of the openly gay bishop Gene Robinson

Pope Benedict XVI, previously Cardinal Joseph Ratzinger, was elected in April of 2005 as the 265th pontiff
Nearly a full year would pass after his resignation before he was sighted again, at a ceremony for cardinals in 2014 ( posted on YouTube )
He reappeared again in 2016 (via Wall Street Journal ) and in 2018 (via Metro UK ), and naturally it was at Masses celebrated by Pope Francis

Benedict ended the service of Father Marcial Maciel Degollado, an influential Mexican priest with a long trail of accusations, and he became the first pope to meet with sexual abuse victims in 2008
But Benedict also became ensnared in the wide-reaching controversy that year, when he was accused of transferring a known pedophile priest during his time as archbishop of Munich in 1980 (the Vatican said that a deputy was responsible for the transfer)
Underscoring the depth of the problem, the wrenching 2012 documentary Mea Maxima Culpa: Silence in the House of God , about the abuse of four deaf boys in the 1960s and the Church&apos;s attempts to bury the allegations, aired shortly before Benedict stepped down
However, Benedict was drawn into the fray in 2010 when Italian authorities seized nearly $30 million of Vatican Bank funds that had been earmarked for transfer, with no satisfactory answer as to what the money was for
The lack of transparency led to another embarrassing turn of events just before Benedict&apos;s exit, with the Vatican briefly relegated to a cash-only operation in early 2013 after Italian banks ceased doing business with the Holy See
The straw that broke the camel&apos;s back may well have been the disclosure of the pope&apos;s personal documents in the "Vatileaks" scandal of 2012
Sentenced to 18 months in prison by a Vatican court, Gabriele was pardoned by the end of 2012 by Benedict, though the damage was already done

In the first decade of her reign, Elizabeth settled into her role as queen, developing a close bond with Prime Minister Winston Churchill (the first of 13 prime ministers she would work with during her reign), weathering a foreign affairs disaster in the Suez Crisis of 1956 and making numerous state trips abroad
In response to pointed criticism in the press, the queen embraced steps to modernize her own image and that of the monarchy, including televising her annual Christmas broadcast for the first time in 1957
Though 2002 marked Queen Elizabeth&#x2019;s Golden Jubilee&#x2014;50 years on the throne&#x2014;the death of her mother (the beloved Queen Mum) and sister early that year cast a pall on the celebrations
In her seventh decade on the throne, Queen Elizabeth presided over the pomp and circumstance of another royal wedding at Westminster Abbey, that of Prince William to Catherine Middleton in April 2011
The couple had a son, Archie Mountbatten-Windsor, in 2019, and a daughter, Lilibet Diana Mountbatten-Windsor, in 2021
At the center of it all is the queen herself, who celebrated her own 90th birthday in 2016 but shows few signs of slowing down

Raￃﾺl Castro , in full Raￃﾺl Modesto Castro Ruz , (born June 3, 1931, Holguￃﾭn province, Cuba), head of state of Cuba (acting president of the Council of State and the Council of Ministers, 2006￢ﾀﾓ08; president of the Council of State and the Council of Ministers, 2008￢ﾀﾓ18), defense minister (1959￢ﾀﾓ2006), and revolutionary who played a pivotal role in the 26th of July Movement , which brought his brother Fidel Castro to power in 1959
Raￃﾺl participated with Fidel in the 1953 attack on Cuba￢ﾀﾙs Moncada Barracks, an unsuccessful attempt to unseat dictator Fulgencio Batista ; the brothers spent nearly two years in prison for the assault until they were pardoned by Batista in 1955
In 1956 Raￃﾺl joined Fidel in launching the revolution that resulted in Fidel￢ﾀﾙs becoming premier in February 1959
He also forged strong links with the Soviet Union and traveled there in 1962 to seek arms for Cuba￢ﾀﾙs armed forces
congressional leaders who traveled to Cuba in December 2006 in hopes of conferring with him
Despite efforts to divine his intentions, Raￃﾺl remained an impassive and inscrutable figure, though the death of his wife￢ﾀﾔfellow rebel fighter who helped bring the Castro brothers to power, first lady of the Cuban Revolution , and women￢ﾀﾙs rights activist￢ﾀﾔin June 2007 likely had a profound impact on him
Raￃﾺl had long occupied the number two position in the three principal bodies of the Cuban hierarchy￢ﾀﾔthe Council of State, the Council of Ministers, and the Communist Party of Cuba ￢ﾀﾔand in 2007 he became the acting head of all three governmental organizations
In September 2010 Raￃﾺl went even farther when he declared increased official toleration of private enterprise and announced that some 500,000 government employees would be laid off
In 2011 he succeeded Fidel as secretary-general of the Communist Party of Cuba
In 2012 Raￃﾺl declared that ￢ﾀﾜthe members of the generation who made the revolution have had the historic privilege of correcting the errors that they themselves have made
￢ﾀﾝ Upon his election to another term as president in February 2013, he announced that he would be stepping down from that office at the end of the term in 2018
Raￃﾺl began to advance political reforms cautiously, and, by the July 2013 arrival of the 60th anniversary of the assault on the Moncada Barracks, the long-awaited generational transition within the leadership of the Communist Party and government appeared to have commenced
He noted that the ￢ﾀﾜHistoric Generation￢ﾀﾝ of men and women who had participated in the toppling of the Batista government in 1959 was ￢ﾀﾜyielding to the new [generation] with tranquility and serene confidence, based on [its] preparation and demonstrated capacity to uphold the banners of the Revolution and Socialism

Roughly a year later, in December 2014, after 18 months of secret negotiations fostered by Canada and the Vatican, Raￃﾺl and Obama stunned the world with the announcement that Cuba and the United States would be normalizing relations that had been suspended in January 1961

Although Raￃﾺl had intended his retirement as president of the Council of State and the Council of Ministers to come at the end of his second term, in February 2018, he announced in December 2017 that he would delay that action until April 2018 so that he could continue to oversee the country￢ﾀﾙs efforts to recover from the damage caused by Hurricane Irma, which had clobbered Cuba￢ﾀﾙs northern coast in September 2017
This change in leadership also roughly coincided with the drafting of a new constitution, which was approved in a referendum by Cuban voters in February 2019
During this period of transition , Cuban-American relations had begun to cool again after the election in 2016 of Donald Trump as the U

Havana (CNN) When Raul Castro announced three years ago that he would step down in 2021 as head of Cuba's all-powerful communist party, he surely envisioned the island on firmer economic footing and the transition to a new generation of leadership nearly complete
The tourism-dependent island has been battered by the pandemic; the economy shrunk at least 11% in 2020 according to government estimates
Castro stayed as head of the party, which oversees long term planning, but said Diaz-Canel would likely assume that position too in 2021 "After that," Castro said in 2018, "If my health permits it, I will be just one more soldier with the people, defending this revolution
Diaz-Canel is the first Cuban who was born after the 1959 revolution to become president
"I believe in continuity," Dￃﾭaz-Canel told reporters in 2018 when asked about his vision for Cuba's future

Pope Benedict XV ( Latin : Benedictus XV ; Italian : Benedetto XV ), born Giacomo Paolo Giovanni Battista della Chiesa [b] ( Italian: [ￋﾈdￊﾒa:komo ￋﾈpa:olo dￊﾒoￋﾈvanni batￋﾈtista della ￋﾈkj￉ﾛ:za] ; 21 November 1854 22 January 1922), was head of the Catholic Church from 1914 until his death in 1922
Between 1846 and 1903, the Catholic Church had experienced two of its longest pontificates in history up to that point
He immediately declared the neutrality of the Holy See and attempted from that perspective to mediate peace in 1916 and 1917
After the war, he repaired the difficult relations with France, which re-established relations with the Vatican in 1921
[4] He named Pietro Gasparri to be his Cardinal Secretary of State and personally consecrated Nuncio Pacelli on 13 May 1917 as Archbishop
After seven years in office, Pope Benedict XV died on 22 January 1922 after battling pneumonia since the start of that month
At age 21 he acquired a doctorate in Law on 2 August 1875
Shortly thereafter, della Chiesa was ordained a priest by Cardinal Raffaele Monaco La Valletta on 21 December 1878 at the Lateran basilica
From 1878 until 1883 he studied at the Pontificia Accademia dei Nobili Ecclesiastici in Rome
Mariano Rampolla , then Secretary for Oriental Affairs of the Congregation for the Propagation of the Faith , took note of him and furthered his entry in the diplomatic service of the Vatican in 1882, where he was employed by Rampolla as a secretary and in January 1883 accompanied nuncio Rampolla to Madrid
Italian papers announced that on 15 April 1907 the papal nuncio Aristide Rinaldini in Madrid would be replaced by della Chiesa, who had worked there before
[17] The unexpected death of his friend, supporter and mentor Rampolla on 16 December 1913 [18] was a major blow to della Chiesa, who was one of the beneficiaries of his will
Cardinal Rampolla died on 16 December 1913
Following the death of Pius X , the resulting conclave opened at the end of August 1914
In the 1914 conclave, the cardinals were divided into two factions: the "reactionaries" and the "conservatives"
His early call for a general Christmas truce in 1914 was ignored, although informal truces were organized
Late in the war, in May￢ﾀﾓOctober 1917, the apparitions of Our Lady of Fatima occurred in Fatima, Portugal , apparitions that would be declared "worthy of belief" in 1930 during the papacy of his successor, Pius XI
He declared the neutrality of the Holy See and attempted from that perspective to mediate peace in 1916 and 1917
These allegations were rejected by the Vatican's Cardinal Secretary of State Pietro Gasparri , who wrote on 4 March 1916 that the Holy See is completely impartial and does not favor the allied side
[30] [31] Benedict also called for outlawing conscription, [32] a call he repeated in 1921
Some of the proposals eventually were included in Woodrow Wilson's Fourteen Points call for peace in January 1918
In addition to his efforts in the field of international diplomacy Pope Benedict also tried to bring about peace through Christian faith, as he published a special prayer in 1915 to be spoken by Catholics throughout the world
He succeeded in 1915 in reaching an agreement by which the warring parties promised not to let prisoners of war (POWs) work on Sundays and holidays
In 1916 he appealed to the people and clergy of the United States to help him feed the starving children in German-occupied Belgium
At the time, the anti-Vatican resentment, combined with Italian diplomatic moves to isolate the Vatican in light of the unresolved Roman Question, [40] contributed to the exclusion of the Vatican from the Paris Peace conference of 1919 (although it was also part of a historical pattern of political and diplomatic marginalization of the papacy after the loss of the Papal States)
[45] On the other hand, he also condemned European nationalism that was rampant in the 1920s and asked for "European Unification" in his 1920 encyclical Pacem Dei Munus Pulcherrimum , "peace, a beautiful gift of God"
Joan was canonized by Pope Benedict XV in 1920
A concordat was agreed upon in principle a year later in June 1920
It was signed on 30 May 1922
Before all other heads of State, Pope Benedict XV in October 1918 congratulated the Polish people on their independence
Cardinal James Gibbons helped secure a meeting between the pope and President Woodrow Wilson which took place on 4 January 1919
The fact that the Pope is purported to have done so was widely accepted by Republicans , though categorically denied later by L'Osservatore Romano in 1933
Additionally, it was alleged that Plunkett pledged the Irish Republic to fidelity to the Holy See, with the Pope formally imparting his blessing on the endeavors of the Irish Republic, prompting the Archbishop of Armagh Michael Logue to send a telegram to the Pope on 30 April 1916 asking for a clarification as to what occurred during the meeting
Plunkett himself affirmed the truth of the allegations, saying "The fact is that the that the Papal Blessing given the men of 1916 by Pope Benedict has only one witness remaining ￢ﾀﾓ myself
In 1917 Benedict XV promulgated the Church's first comprehensive Code of Canon Law , the preparation of which had been commissioned by Pope Pius X , and which is thus known as the Pio-Benedictine Code
[4] In addition, continuing the concerns of Leo XIII , he furthered Eastern Catholic culture, theology and liturgy by founding an Oriental Institute for them in Rome [4] and creating the Sacred Congregation for the Oriental Church in 1917
[5] He condemned the misuse of Marian statues and pictures, dressed in priestly robes, which he outlawed 4 April 1916
He issued an encyclical on Ephraim the Syrian depicting Ephraim as a model of Marian devotion, as well as the Apostolic Letter Inter Soldalica of 22 March 1918
He named Ephrem the Syrian as a Doctor of the Church on 5 October 1920
The pope's death in 1922 therefore invalidated the second appointment (it has been alleged that the second in pectore cardinal was to be Pavel Huyn )
[89] Benedict XV also created his immediate successor Achille Ratti as a cardinal in 1921
In the 1916 consistory, no German or Austro-Hungarian cardinals were able to attend due to the intensity of the war
In the 1921 consistory, Benedict XV is reported to have said, that "We gave you the red robe of a Cardinal
Death [ edit ] Benedict XV lying in state in 1922
Benedict XV celebrated Mass with the nuns at the Domus Sanctae Marthae in early January 1922 and while he waited for his driver out in the rain he fell ill with the flu which turned into pneumonia
Pope Benedict XVI showed his own admiration for Benedict XV following his election to the papacy on 19 April 2005

Raul Castro says he is stepping down as head of Cuba￢ﾀﾙs Communist Party, ending an era of formal leadership by he and his brother Fidel Castro that began with the 1959 revolution By andrea Rodrￃﾭguez Associated Press April 16, 2021, 9:15 PM 2:56 Raul Castro, first secretary of the Communist Party and former president, attends the VIII Congress of the Communist Party of Cuba's opening session, at the Convention Palace in Havana, Cuba, Friday, April 16, 2021
HAVANA -- Raul Castro said Friday he is stepping down as head of Cuba ￢ﾀﾙs Communist Party, ending an era of formal leadership that began with his brother Fidel and country￢ﾀﾙs 1959 revolution
But he previously indicated he favors yielding control to 60-year-old Miguel Dￃﾭaz-Canel, who succeeded him as president in 2018 and is the standard bearer of a younger generation of loyalists who have been pushing an economic opening without touching Cuba￢ﾀﾙs one-party system
He quickly absorbed the old party under his control and was the country￢ﾀﾙs unquestioned leader until falling ill in 2006 and in 2008 handing over the presidency to his younger brother Raul, who had fought alongside him during the revolution
Raul succeeded him as head of the party in 2011
The fourth of seven children of a Spanish immigrant in eastern Cuba, Raul had joined his charismatic older brother in a nearly suicidal attack on the Moncada military barracks in the eastern city of Santiago in 1953 and survived the crackdown that followed from the forces of dictator Fulgencio Batista

Raul Castro said Friday he is resigning as head of Cuba's Communist Party, ending an era of leadership that began with his brother Fidel and the country's 1959 revolution
But he previously indicated he favors yielding control to 60-year-old Miguel D&iacute;az-Canel, who succeeded him as president in 2018 and is the standard bearer of a younger generation of loyalists who have been pushing an economic opening without touching Cuba's one-party system
He quickly absorbed the old party under his control and was the country's unquestioned leader until falling ill in 2006
Raul succeeded him as head of the party in 2011
Fidel Castro died in 2016
The fourth of seven children of a Spanish immigrant in eastern Cuba, Raul had joined his charismatic older brother in a nearly suicidal attack on the Moncada military barracks in the eastern city of Santiago in 1953 and survived the crackdown that followed from the forces of Batista

The band broke up in 1984 as Rubin's passion moved towards the NYC hip hop scene
Producer Arthur Baker helped to distribute the record worldwide on Baker's Streetwise Records in 1984
Simmons and Rubin edged out Jazzy Jay and the official Def Jam record label was founded while Rubin was attending New York University in 1984
This 1986 production is often credited with both introducing rap hard rock to mainstream ears and revitalizing Aerosmith's career
Rubin would later work with The Cult again for the single "The Witch", in 1992
Rubin portrayed a character based on himself in the 1985 hip-hop motion picture Krush Groove , which was inspired by the early days of Russell Simmons ' career as an artist management and music producer
film, Tougher Than Leather in 1988
In 1993 Rubin found that the word "def" had been accepted into the standardized dictionary and held an actual funeral for the word, complete with a casket, a grave, celebrity mourners and a eulogy from The Reverend Al Sharpton
The Man Comes Around earned a 2003 Grammy for Best Male Country Vocal Performance ("Give My Love to Rose") and a nomination for Best Country Collaboration with Vocals (" Bridge over Troubled Water " with Fiona Apple )
Arguably his biggest success as producer came from working with the Red Hot Chili Peppers with whom Rubin produced six studio albums from 1991 to 2011, starting with the band's fifth release, Blood Sugar Sex Magik , which launched the band to mainstream success thanks to the hit singles " Give It Away " and " Under the Bridge "
The six albums with the Chili Peppers also spawned twelve number one singles on the Billboard Alternative Songs chart, a record the band as of 2015 still holds, and various awards including sixteen Grammy Nominations (with six wins) with a Producer of the Year Grammy award for 2006's Stadium Arcadium , which was also nominated for Album of the Year
After 24 years of working with Rubin, the band announced in late 2014 that they would be working with another producer on their eleventh studio album
He also produced Mick Jagger 's 1993 Wandering Spirit album, Lords of Acid 's 1994 Voodoo-U album, Tom Petty 's 1994 Wildflowers , AC/DC 's 1995 Ballbreaker , Donovan 's 1996 Sutras , System of a Down 's 1998 System of a Down , and Metallica 's 2008 Death Magnetic
Rubin co-produced Linkin Park 's 2007 album Minutes to Midnight with Mike Shinoda
Rubin and Shinoda have since co-produced the band's 2010 album, A Thousand Suns , and their June 2012 release, Living Things
Michael Kranz, Red Hot Chili Peppers , U2 , Green Day , and Johnny Cash released in 2006 [19] Rubin won the award again in 2009, for production work for Metallica , Neil Diamond , Ours , Jakob Dylan , and Weezer in 2008
In 2007 and 2012 , Rubin won the Grammy Award for Album of the Year
Rubin financially backed Jim Cornette 's Smoky Mountain Wrestling for most of its run from 1991 to 1995
Rubin was featured as one of Supreme's "photo tees" during their Fall/Winter 2021 season
In 2010 at the Music Producers Guild (MPG) awards, Matt Bellamy of Muse criticized Rubin while accepting the award for UK single of the year, stating that the band would "like to thank Rick Rubin for teaching us how not to produce

In 1937 , Ratzinger's father retired and setled in the town of Traunstein
When Ratzinger turned 14 in 1941 , as required by law he joined the Hitler Youth
In 1943 , at the age of 16, Ratzinger was, along with the rest of his class, drafted into the Flak or anti-aircraft corps, responsible for the guarding of a BMW plant outside Munich
He was then sent for basic infantry training and was posted to Hungary , where he worked setting up anti-tank defences until deserting in April 1944
In 1945 , Ratzinger was briefly held in an Allied POW camp, where he attended de-Nazification classes
Ratzinger was a professor at the University of Bonn from 1959 until 1963, when he moved to the University of M&uuml;nster
On November 25, 1981, Pope John Paul II named Ratzinger prefect of the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith, formerly known as the Holy Office of the Inquisition, which was renamed in 1908 by Pope Pius X
He was already one of the most influential men in the Vatican before he became Pope and presided over the funeral of John Paul II and the Conclave in 2005 that elected him
This is the 16th Pope to choose the name Benedict; the last such named Pope (Benedict XV) served as Pope from 1914 to 1922 and was the Pope during the years of World War I
For example, during the 2004 U
Pope Benedict held his first audience for 25 Jewish leaders from Israel, the United States, Europe and Latin America on June 9, 2005
The Pope had issed a Motu Propio edict permitting the use of this version of the prayer from the 1962 Latin Tridentine missal in July 2007
But after protests from leaders in the Jewish community, the Pope drafted a new version to be used in time for the Holy Week celebrations in March 2008
For example, he personally prepared Memory and Reconciliation , the 1999 document outlining the church's historical errors in its treatment of Jews
Ratzinger also authorized the 2002 publication, The Jewish People and the Holy Scriptures, prepared by the Pontifical Biblical Commission
According to the Religious News Service, Ratzinger's warm tone and repeated emphasis on Christianity's roots in Judaism appeared aimed at easing severe strains caused by the controversial document on salvation that his congregation issued in September 2000
Though the Vatican already rejected the claim in general terms in 1965 with the Nostra Aetate document, Benedict employs a thorough scholarly analysis of Catholic teaching to clearly draw the conclusion based on scripture

ￂﾩ 1990- 2022 by IMDb
With the help of his father, he joined Nintendo in 1977 after impressing then-president Hiroshi Yamauchi with his toys
[3] He helped create art for the arcade game Sheriff , [4] and was later tasked with designing a new arcade game, leading to the 1981 game Donkey Kong
[9] He was inspired to enter the video game industry by the 1978 arcade hit Space Invaders
After showing some of his toy creations, he was hired in 1977 as an apprentice in the planning department
[4] He first helped the company develop a game after the 1980 release Radar Scope
[14] :47 Miyamoto also named " Beauty and the Beast " and the 1933 film King Kong as influences
in 1982 and Donkey Kong 3 in 1983
In January 1983, the 1982 Arcade Awards gave Donkey Kong the Best Single-player video game award and the Certificate of Merit as runner-up forCoin-Op Game of the Year
The game and the system are credited with helping to bring North America out of the slump of the 1983 game industry crash
[20] [21] It was a culmination of Miyamoto's gameplay concepts and technical knowledge drawn from his experiences of designing Donkey Kong , Mario Bros , Devil World (1984), the side-scrolling racing game Excitebike (1984), and the 1985 NES port of side-scrolling beat 'em up Kung-Fu Master (1984)
The game was first revealed at Nintendo Space World 2000 as a technical demo designed to show off the graphical capabilities of the GameCube
Luigi's Mansion was later shown at E3 2001 with the GameCube console
At E3 2004 , Miyamoto unveiled The Legend of Zelda: Twilight Princess , appearing dressed as the protagonist Link with a sword and shield
Miyamoto produced three major Mario titles for Wii from 2007 to 2010: Super Mario Galaxy , New Super Mario Bros
[48] He was relieved of this position in September 2015 when Tatsumi Kimishima assumed the role of the company's president
Miyamoto oversaw the design and construction of the land and its attractions and acted as Nintendo's public representative on the land, hosting several promotional materials including a December 2020 Nintendo Direct in which he gave a tour of parts of the land
In a 1992 interview, he said "the important thing is that it feels good when you're playing it" and "that quality is not determined by the story, but by the controls, the sound, and the rhythm and pacing"
In a 1992 interview, when asked whether Zelda is an RPG series, he declined but classified it as "a real-time adventure"; he said he was "not interested in [games] decided by stats and numbers [but in preserving] as much of that 'live' feeling as possible", which he said " action games are better suited in conveying"
[65] [64] Computer and Video Games called Donkey Kong "the most momentous" release of 1981
[59] G4 noted its revolutionary gameplay and its role in "almost single-handedly" rescuing the video game industry after the North American video game crash of 1983
A 1995 article in Maximum stated that "in gaming circles Miyamoto's name carries far more weight than Steven Spielberg 's could ever sustain
32million on the GameCube as of March 31, 2007
[110] He was later chosen as one of Time Magazine's 100 Most Influential People of the Year in both 2007 [111] and also in 2008, in which he topped the list with a total vote of 1,766,424
[117] He was made a Fellow of BAFTA at the British Academy Video Games Awards on March 19, 2010
Miyamoto was awarded Japan's Person of Cultural Merit in 2019 in recognition for his contributions towards Japan's video game industry

￢ﾀﾝ Richard Dawkins speaks at the Cambridge Union debate about the role of religion in the 21st century, in 2013
The Dawkins mission has many components: in addition to his books and speeches, there is also the Richard Dawkins Foundation for Reason and Science (RDFRS), which he founded in 2006
Dawkins and Ward have lived in a large house in north Oxford since 1996
￢ﾀﾜI distinctly heard the triumphal opening chords of Also sprach Zarathustra ￢ﾀﾓ the 2001 theme ￢ﾀﾓ in my mind,￢ﾀﾝ he wrote in The Blind Watchmaker (1986)
Most days he cycles in for lunch at New College, where he has been a fellow since 1970
He has no duties in college, and stopped teaching in 1995 when he became the first Charles Simonyi professor for the public understanding of science, but he likes to maintain the connection
On occasion, his online utterances descend into farce, as when he took to Twitter in 2013 to rage over having an item confiscated by airport security, declaring: ￢ﾀﾜBin Laden has won, in airports of the world every day
Greta Christina, an American feminist and atheist blogger, first met Dawkins at an event in 2009
As a fellow at New College, he agitated to allow women to be admitted, a change that occurred in 1979
There will be no prayers, obviously, but the ceremony will include the first sentences of his 1998 book, Unweaving the Rainbow: ￢ﾀﾜWe are going to die, and that makes us the lucky ones

Born in 1955 to two University of Wisconsin graduate students who gave him up for adoption, Jobs was smart but directionless, dropping out of college and experimenting with different pursuits before co-founding Apple with Steve Wozniak in 1976

Rudy Giuliani (full name Rudolph William Louis Giuliani ) served as the 107th Mayor of New York City from January 1, 1994 until December 31, 2001
One of Bratton's first initiatives was the institution in 1994 of CompStat , a comparative statistical approach to mapping crime geographically in order to identify emerging criminal patterns and chart officer performance by quantifying apprehensions
[2] The CompStat initiative won the 1996 Innovations in Government Award from the Kennedy School of Government
Bratton, not Giuliani, was featured on the cover of Time Magazine in 1996
Crime rates in New York City started to drop in 1991 under previous mayor David Dinkins , three years before Giuliani took office
In 2005 Giuliani was reportedly nominated for a Nobel Peace Prize for his efforts to reduce crime rates in the city
[22] [23] [24] The ramifications of this action extended beyond the end of Giuliani's mayoralty: President Bush signed the Protection of Lawful Commerce in Arms Act in October 2005 in an effort to protect gun companies from liability
In 2000 Giuliani initiated what the New York Post called "a massive program" to get city employees to expand the number of low-income, uninsured children and adults covered by public health entitlement programs such as Medicaid , Child Health Plus and Family Health Plan
" In 1996 he said that the new anti-illegal immigration law, as well as the Welfare Reform Act , were "inherently unfair
From 1994 to 2001, Giuliani hosted the Live From City Hall With Rudy Giuliani show weekly on Friday mid-days on WABC radio
As depicted in the documentary Giuliani Time , Parkinson's disease patient John Hynes called Giuliani's show in January 2000 to complain about being cut off from Medicaid after paying more than $100,000 of taxes in his life before he was disabled with the disease
The Rangers' Stanley Cup win in 1994￢ﾀﾔ first in 54 years ￢ﾀﾔmade Giuliani the first New York City mayor to witness a first New York sports team championship victory during their first year in office since Ed Koch when the New York Yankees , of which Rudy Giuliani is an enthusiastic fan, won the 1978 World Series
Giuliani has also been to games of the New York Mets as well, including their season openers in 1996 , when he threw out the ceremonial first pitch along with the Governor of New York George Pataki , [73] and in 1998 , [74] and when the Mets hosted the first professional sporting event in New York since September 11, 2001
The gifts possibly included tickets, souvenirs, and World Series rings from 1996 , 1998 , 1999 , and 2000
However, the Yankees' public relations firm produced documents that the rings were sold to Giuliani for a total of $16,000 in 2003 and 2004, although this departs from usual industry practice
[78] This contrasted with Giuliani's campaign promise during the 1989 campaign to build hundreds of new homeless shelters around the city
However, he cut the public school budget in New York City by $2 billion from 1994 to 1997 and trimmed the school repairs budget by $4
Giuliani had said in his 1993 campaign that parochial school vouchers were "unconstitutional
" [80] Yet in 1999 he placed $12 million into the budget for parochial school vouchers
[103] [104] In 1996 Giuliani sued the federal government over a new federal law ( Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act of 1996 ) that overturned the 1985 executive order by then mayor Ed Koch that barred government employees from turning in illegal immigrants who were trying to get government benefits from the city
Some of the court cases which found the Giuliani administration to have violated First Amendment rights included actions barring public events from their previous location at the City Hall steps, not allowing taxi drivers to assemble for a protest, not allowing city workers to speak to the press without permission, barring church members from delivering an AIDS education program in a park, denying a permit for a march to object to police brutality, issuing summons and seizing literature of three workers collecting signatures to get a candidate on the presidential ballot, imposing strict licensing restrictions on sidewalk artists that were struck down by a court of appeals as a violation of artists' rights, using a 1926 cabaret law to ban dancing in bars and clubs, imposing an excessive daily fee on street musicians, imposing varying city fees for newsstand owners based on the content they sold, a case against Time Warner Cable, and an incident in which Giuliani ordered an ad for New York magazine that featured his image taken down from city buses
Giuliani and his administration encountered accusations of blocking free speech arising from a lawsuit brought by Fifth Avenue Presbyterian Church for removing the homeless from the church's steps against the church's will, and during his 1993 campaign, when he criticized incumbent Mayor Dinkins for allowing Louis Farrakhan to speak in the city
" [119] [120] The 1999 award was the Center's first "Lifetime Muzzle Award," which noted he had "stifled speech and press to so unprecedented a degree, and in so many and varied forms, that simply keeping up with the city's censorious activity has proved a challenge for defenders of free expression
Staten Island had been an important constituency in electing Giuliani to his two terms, and would again be important if he ran for the Senate in 2000

Steve Jobs' abrasive attitude and often controversial thinking were as much a boon as a detriment, leading to failures like the Lisa computer, company infighting, and his ousting in 1985
From 1976 to 1997, Steve Jobs led a very busy life
The launch of the Macintosh in 1984 was met with much excitement
Between the controversial advertisement, fighting in the company, and Steve Jobs' overgrown ambition, things reached a tipping point in 1985
Between this and Black Tuesday, the company was shrinking by 1993
Laurene Powell Jobs inherited these shares and sold half of them in 2017
The December 1996 acquisition brought Steve Jobs with it, but only as an "advisor" to the CEO
That stock was sold back to Apple in 2003
From 1998 to today, Apple has rocketed upward to become the biggest consumer electronics company in the world
The iMac released in 1998 and was so well received by the public that it alone brought Apple back from the dead
The first MacBook launched in 2006 and was well received, but Apple released the real winner in 2008: the MacBook Air
The campus was finished in 2017 and has since then been the official home of Apple
Steve Jobs was diagnosed with cancer in 2003
Jobs underwent surgery in 2004 and had the tumor removed
A few years later, Jobs appeared to be sick on stage during a 2006 keynote
Jobs did not return to work full time until late 2009

Steve Jobs: Original Motion Picture Soundtrack is the soundtrack album to the 2015 film Steve Jobs , directed by Danny Boyle and written by Aaron Sorkin , based on the life of Apple Inc
[4] [5] A two-disc vinyl set was released on February 5, 2016
For the first act's composition, Pemberton primarily used analog synthesizers, in particular ones released no later than 1984 ￢ﾀﾓ the time the first act takes place ￢ﾀﾓ such as the Roland SH-1000 and Yamaha CS-80
[9] The third and final act featured a more introspective score produced entirely digitally to complement its backdrop of the 1998 iMac product launch, and Pemberton correspondingly used his own iMac with MacOS ( Apple software ) to compose this section as "more experimental sound textures, sound design are featured inside the computer"

The Alliance of Californians for Community Empowerment and The Center for Popular Democracy noted in a 2019 report: ￢ﾀﾜThrough vulturous practices and the exertion of political influence through campaign contributions and political spending, Blackstone￢ﾀﾙs Invitation Homes and Equity Residential, like other private equity and Wall Street landlords, profit from and exacerbate California￢ﾀﾙs housing crisis, pushing more people into housing instability
He received a Master of Business Administration degree from Harvard University in 1972
He worked up the ranks at the investment bank Lehman Brothers, and then co-founded Blackstone Group, a private equity firm, in 1985
￢ﾀﾜThe opening was treated almost like a Hollywood premiere at the New York Stock Exchange,￢ﾀﾝ the New York Times reported in 2007 , ￢ﾀﾜwhere television trucks from networks around the world lined up to report the offering, the biggest on Wall Street and the most-high profile since Google went public in 2004

￢ﾀﾜSchwarzman has emerged as one of Trump￢ﾀﾙs most generous donors,￢ﾀﾝ the Washington Post reported in 2018 , ￢ﾀﾜas well as a key advisor with rare and regular access to the president
￢ﾀﾜIt￢ﾀﾙs like when Hitler invaded Poland in 1939
8 million in compensation for 2018 , United Nations experts Leilani Farha and Surya Deva sent letters to Schwarzman and several governments, igniting a media firestorm about Blackstone￢ﾀﾙs role in the global housing affordability crisis
Senator Elizabeth Warren repeatedly criticized Blackstone for allegedly financing the destruction of the Amazon and worsening climate change, and for ￢ﾀﾜshamelessly￢ﾀﾝ profiting from the 2008 financial crisis
Quietly, Blackstone delivered $7 million to the California Business Roundtable Issues PAC in June 2020
According to activists, critics, and United Nations experts, Schwarzman has made mountains of cash by manipulating tenants and rental markets, buying off politicians, fooling voters, fueling a global housing affordability crisis, profiting off the 2008 financial crisis, instituting excessive rents increases and aggressive evictions, and the list goes on

Sacha grew up in a Jewish household with older brothers Erran and Amnon, and he attended The Haberdashers' Aske's Boys' School and studied history at Christ's College, Cambridge, graduating with upper-second-class honours in 1993
Sacha reprised the role of Ali G in Madonna's 2006 video for "Music
Sacha played the lead in 2019 Netflix series "The Spy," and he has appeared on "Curb Your Enthusiasm" (2005) and "Eastbound and Down" (2013)
In 2010, it was announced that he would play Freddie Mercury in "Bohemian Rhapsody," but Sacha and Queen's surviving members couldn't agree on what type of movie it should be, so he left the project in 2013
His replacement, Rami Malek, won an Oscar for the role in 2019
The following year, a Palestinian grocer sued Baron Cohen for defamation, saying that "Brￃﾼno" had falsely portrayed him as a terrorist; the case was settled out of court in 2012
In the interview, Baron Cohen posed as an anti-terrorism expert with a "pedophile detector" that beeped when it was near Moore, who had been accused of sexual assault and child molestation while (unsuccessfully) running for a Senate seat in 2017
The Evening Standard British Film Awards has awarded him the Peter Sellers Award for Comedy twice: in 2007 for "Borat" and in 2010 for "Brￃﾼno
" The Anti Defamation League honored Sacha with an International Leadership Award in 2019 for his commitment to exposing racism and bigotry through satire

Tras unas pr&aacute;cticas en la empresa Hewlett-Packard en Palo Alto, en 1974 Jobs fue contratado como dise&ntilde;ador por Atari, compa&ntilde;&iacute;a pionera de la por entonces naciente industria de los videojuegos
El lanzamiento del Macintosh en 1984 supuso un vuelco en las perspectivas del mercado
As&iacute; nacieron en 1986 los Estudios de Animaci&oacute;n Pixar, centrados en la producci&oacute;n por ordenador de pel&iacute;culas de dibujos animados; tan s&oacute;lo tres a&ntilde;os despu&eacute;s, una de las pel&iacute;culas realizadas por los estudios, Tin Toy (1988), mereci&oacute; el Oscar de la Academia al mejor cortometraje animado
La enemistad entre dos personalidades tan contrapuestas como el hipercreativo Steve Jobs y el funcionarial Bill Gates ser&iacute;a el tema de una pel&iacute;cula televisiva titulada Piratas del Silicon Valley , producida en 1998 por la cadena TNT
Derrotada en sus pleitos contra Microsoft y sumergida en una profunda crisis, en diciembre de 1996 Apple decidi&oacute; comprar NeXT Computer, lo que supuso la vuelta de Steve Jobs a la empresa por &eacute;l fundada con un cargo de asesor interino (por el que Jobs, voluntariamente, no recib&iacute;a ning&uacute;n salario)
El primero fue la m&uacute;sica digital: en 2001 desembarc&oacute; en el sector musical con un reproductor de audio de bolsillo, el iPod, y dos a&ntilde;os despu&eacute;s cre&oacute; la tienda musical iTunes, que lider&oacute; de inmediato la venta de m&uacute;sica en l&iacute;nea y sigue manteniendo su posici&oacute;n dominante
En 2007 present&oacute; el iPhone, primero de la familia de tel&eacute;fonos inteligentes de alta gama producida por Apple
Con su creatividad intacta, todav&iacute;a en 2010 sorprendi&oacute; al mundo con el iPad, un h&iacute;brido de tableta y tel&eacute;fono m&oacute;vil; una ligera y delgad&iacute;sima pantalla t&aacute;ctil de 9,7 pulgadas conten&iacute;a en su parte posterior la potencia de procesamiento y todas las prestaciones de un ordenador port&aacute;til, sin necesidad de teclado ni rat&oacute;n
El 5 de octubre de 2011, a los 56 a&ntilde;os de edad, falleci&oacute; en su casa de Palo Alto, v&iacute;ctima del avance del c&aacute;ncer que le hab&iacute;a sido detectado en 2003
Barcelona, Espa&ntilde;a, 2004
After working together for a while, in 1998 the pair decided to put their PhDs on hold in order to take their extraordinary idea to market
They have a son (born 2008) and a daughter (born 2011) but the couple separated in 2013

The club started to gain popularity after the Altair 8800 personal computer kit came out in 1975
Jobs convinced Wozniak to start a company for that purpose: Apple Computer was born on April 1, 1976
He eventually convinced former Intel executive turned business angel Mike Markkula to invest in Apple to the tune of $250,000 (roughly equivalent to $1 million in today's dollars) in January 1977
It was the biggest threat yet to Apple, whose reputation was being put into question after the flop of the Apple III in 1980
Steve was supported in his mission by John Sculley, Apple's new CEO whom he hired in 1983 to help him run the company and groom him into a future chief executive
On January 24 1984, after Apple had run a very memorable TV commercial for the Super Bowl ( 1984 ), Steve Jobs introduced Macintosh at the company's annual shareholders meeting
These ambitious plans put off the release date of the computer ￢ﾀﾔ called the NeXT Cube ￢ﾀﾔ to October 1988
To understand how Steve Jobs got out of his nadir, let's go back eight years earlier, in late 1985
Steve Jobs understood this when the studio won an Academy Award for its short movie Tin Toy in 1989
However, just like NeXT's, sales of Pixar hardware were microscopic, and the company went software-only in 1990
Steve understood this new momentum full well: he planned to take Pixar public the week following the release of the movie, in November 1995
A new CEO, Gil Amelio, arrived in early 1996 to save the company
Introduced in May 1998 , it was Apple's first truly innovative product since the original Macintosh of 1984
Design innovations continued throughout 1998 and 1999 with the colored iMacs and the iBook, Apple's consumer notebook
At Macworld in January 2000 , Steve Jobs made two significant announcements: first, he demoed Aqua, the graphics-intensive user interface that Apple would use in its next-generation operating system derived from NeXTSTEP, Mac OS X
The Mac OS X team worked very hard and released six major versions of the system at a roughly yearly cadence between 2001 and 2007 ￢ﾀﾔeach time delivering more stability, speed, and new user features
The continuous improvement of Mac OS X and its powerful core technologies and developer tools proved key in the success of the Digital Hub strategy, which Steve Jobs unveiled in January 2001
Steve Jobs explained it to the Apple community at Macworld in January 2001 , the same day he unveiled the second and third of the iApps: iDVD ￢ﾀﾔto let you burn your own DVDs￢ﾀﾔ and iTunes, a digital jukebox software
Other iApps would follow: iPhoto in 2002, GarageBand in 2004, and iWeb in 2006
We've already covered Mac OS X and the Digital Hub strategy, both unveiled in January 2001
A third key decision was taken in 2000 and unveiled in mid-2001: that of creating a fully-owned retail channel, the famous Apple retail stores
Finally, it was in 2000 that Jobs started realizing his mistake of betting only on digital movies, and reoriented the company's efforts to another media: music
Although Jobs was initially staunchly opposed to the latter idea, he eventually relented, and the first Windows iPods were introduced in July 2002 at Macworld New York
He went to all record labels to negotiate landmark deals that would lead to the introduction of the iTunes Music Store in April 2003
It was introduced to Windows as well six months later , in October 2003
The iPod adventure was far from over, since Apple introduced the $99 iPod shuffle and the 'impossibly small' iPod nano in 2005, and the iPod video in 2006
Finally, it was iPod which, through the crowds it attracted to the company's retail stores, finally helped the Mac business of Apple, whose growth rate started outpacing that of consumer Windows PCs from 2005
Turns out his opinion was shared by many an executive at Disney ￢ﾀﾔ including Walt's own nephew, Roy Disney, who started a public campaign to oust the company's CEO in late 2003
This led to the nomination of Bob Iger as new CEO in September 2005
Iger accepted, and both men appeared on stage in October 2005 to announce that Disney would be selling TV shows on the iTunesￂﾠStore
In many ways, it was as if Pixar had taken over Disney animation ￢ﾀﾔa reverse acquisition reminiscent of NeXT taking over Apple after the 1996 merger
After two more years of development, iPhone was introduced at Macworld on January 9, 2007
But the demand was so high that he eventually relented, and introduced the iPhone SDK and the App Store in March 2008
Only in July 2004 did he agree to have the surgery
He looked healthy for the next five years, and spoke publicly of being 'cured' of cancer at his famous Stanford commencement speech in 2005
Yet at the WWDC keynote in June 2008 , few observers failed to notice how thin he appeared on stage, and concerns about his health started popping up again
He was actually weeks away from death when he received a liver transplant, in April 2009
Although iPad was welcomed by mixed reviews when it was introduced in January 2010 (some dubbed it a "larger iPod touch"), it was always clear to Steve Jobs that it was 'the biggest thing [he'd] ever done' ￢ﾀﾔthe ultimate post-PC device, an eventual replacement of PCs for the average user
The 2011 iCloud, which allowed users to sync email, documents, and media across their Macs and iDevices, was only the first step in that direction
All of this was in place when he eventually resigned as Apple CEO on August 24, 2011

They were married in New Delhi in 1968
During the years 1984 to 1991 when her husband was Prime Minister and then briefly leader of the Opposition in the Lok Sabha, she assumed a limited public role, mostly accompanying him on his tours in the country and abroad
She campaigned vigorously on behalf of the party and became the President of the Indian National Congress Party in April 1998
In the 2004 General Elections, she led the electoral campaign of her Party which secured the largest number of seats
Following the resignation of Rahul Ghandhi as the Congress party preseident after INC suffered a huge blow in the 2019 general elections, Sonia Gandhi stepped in as the interim president
She has edited two volumes of letters exchanged between Pandit Jawaharlal Nehru and Indira Gandhi between 1922 and 1964, entitled "Freedom's Daughter" and "Two Alone, Two Together"
2019 Following the resignation of Rahul Ghandhi as the Congress party preseident, Sonia Gandhi stepped in as the interim president
2014 In 2014 Lok Sabha Elections, she won the Lok Sabha seat from Raebareli for the 4th term
2009 In 2009 Lok Sabha Elections, she was re-elected from Raebareli constituency for the third term
2006 She was re-elected from her constituency Raebareli Uttar Pradesh
2004 In the 2004 Lok Sabha Elections, she won the Lok Sabha seat from Raebareli Uttar Pradesh
1999 She was elected Leader of the Opposition of the 13th Lok Sabha
1999 She contested Lok Sabha elections from Amethi Uttar Pradesh and Bellary Karnataka and won both the seats
1998 She became Party Leader of Indian National Congress
1997 Sonia Gandhi joined Indian National Congress as a Primary Member
Gandhi was seen as the most powerful politician of India from 2004 - 2014, and variously listed among the most powerful people and women listings by magazines
In 2007, she had been named the third most powerful woman in the world by the same magazine and was ranked 6th in exclusive list in 2007
She was ranked 12 in 2012 in forbes' powerful people list
Sonia was also named among the Time 100 most influential people in the world for the years 2007 and 2008
New Statesman listed Sonia Gandhi at number 29 in their annual survey of "The World's 50 Most Influential Figures" in the year 2010
In 2008 she was conferred a Honorary Doctorate (Literature) from University of Madras
In 2006 she was conferred a Honorary Doctorate from Brussels University
After leaving Oregon in 1974 to return to California, Jobs started working for Atari , an early pioneer in the manufacturing of personal computers
on April 1, 1979
However, a power struggle with the board of directors led to Jobs leaving Apple in 1985
Ironically, Apple bought NeXT in 1996 and Jobs returned to his old company to serve once more as its CEO from 1997 until his retirement in 2011
Steve Jobs died at his home in Palo Alto, California, on October 5, 2011

co-founders Steve Jobs (Michael Fassbender) and Steve "Woz" Wozniak get ready to unveil the first Macintosh in 1984
and prepares to release a new computer model in 1988
Sep 27, 2016 Michael Fassbender offers a remarkable performance in this rapid and complex biopic
Aug 02, 2016 http://cinephilecrocodile
Jul 06, 2016 While it rightly deserves to be praised for the performance Michael Fassbender (most notably) and company put in over the course of two hours on screen, a few faults lie within the one note it seems to continuously strike through the three 'chapters' we get to see the tech giant live his life
We essentially get a look-in at how Steve Jobs morphed from 1984 to 1988 to 1998, and while Fassbender executes subtle differences in each year, it mostly feels like the same repeat scene three different times
Steve Cohen taught high school history for two decades and has taught at Tufts since 1995

Stephen Frand Cohen (November 25, 1938 September 18, 2020) was an American scholar of Russian studies
Cohen was a founding director of the 2015 reestablished American Committee for East￢ﾀﾓWest Accord
in economics and public policy in 1960 and an M
in government and Russian studies in 1962
[6] Richard Lowenthal in a 1985 review of Cohen's Rethinking the Soviet Experience: Politics and History since 1917 said that many scholars of history consider "such an iffy assumption as illegitimate"
[8] During the Cold War , Cohen was critical of both Western hawks and also the Soviet government, which banned him from visiting the country from 1982 to 1985
[9] Cohen said in early 1985 that the reasons had not been revealed to him
[9] In a March 1991 op-ed for The New York Times , he wrote that Gorbachev's government "has undertaken the most ambitious changes in modern history
Cohen wrote that the US continued the Cold War after the breakup of the Soviet Union in 1991
He said that President Bill Clinton backtracked on the promise of his predecessor not to extend NATO eastward and the flawed interpretation of an "American victory" and a "Russian defeat", which he believed in 2006 led US leaders to believe that Russia would submit completely to US foreign policy
Cohen was a friend of former Soviet President Mikhail Gorbachev , who invited him to attend the 1989 May Day parade in Red Square, [2] [12] and advised former U
In an article for The Nation , published in the March 3, 2014 issue, Cohen wrote that "media malpractice" had resulted in the "relentless demonization of Putin" who was not an "autocrat"
In a May 2014 Nation column coauthored with his wife, Cohen wrote that President Barack Obama had unilaterally declared a new Cold War against Russia and that those inside the Beltway were complicit in it by their silence
Even Henry Kissinger ￢ﾀﾔI think it was in March 2014 in The Washington Post ￢ﾀﾔwrote this line: 'The demonization of Putin is not a policy
In a June 30, 2014 article in The Nation , Cohen said the US was complicit in creating the crisis in Ukraine due to its support for the overthrow of President Viktor Yanukovych
In a 2014 article in The Nation , Cohen wrote that "the US-picked prime minister, Arseniy Yatsenyuk , referred to resisters in the Southeast as 'subhumans'
In a 2015 interview, Cohen stated that "this notion that this is all Putin￢ﾀﾙs aggression, or Russia￢ﾀﾙs aggression, is, if not 100-percent false, let us say, for the sake of being balanced and ecumenical, it's 50-percent false
In 2017, Cohen said the events of 2014 in Ukraine had initiated a civil war in a country in which "one part tilts toward Russia and one part tilts toward the West"
Cohen had a son and a daughter from his first marriage in 1962 to opera singer Lynn Blair, whom he later divorced

[17] [18] [7] Between 1979 and 2009, he was the Lucasian Professor of Mathematics at the University of Cambridge
[46] From 1958 on, with the help of the mathematics teacher Dikran Tahta , they built a computer from clock parts, an old telephone switchboard and other recycled components
Despite his headmaster's advice to wait until the next year, Hawking was awarded a scholarship after taking the examinations in March 1959
[63] After receiving a first-class BA degree in physics and completing a trip to Iran with a friend, he began his graduate work at Trinity Hall, Cambridge , in October 1962
[72] [73] Hawking started developing a reputation for brilliance and brashness when he publicly challenged the work of Fred Hoyle and his student Jayant Narlikar at a lecture in June 1964
[77] [78] Hawking's thesis [79] was approved in 1966
Their joint essay was the runner-up in the 1968 Gravity Research Foundation competition
[93] [94] His essay titled "Black Holes" won the Gravity Research Foundation Award in January 1971
[95] Hawking's first book, The Large Scale Structure of Space-Time , written with George Ellis , was published in 1973
[104] [105] [106] Hawking was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society (FRS) in 1974 , a few weeks after the announcement of Hawking radiation
Hawking was appointed to the Sherman Fairchild Distinguished Visiting Professorship at the California Institute of Technology (Caltech) in 1974
Hawking returned to Cambridge in 1975 to a more academically senior post, as reader in gravitational physics
[115] In 1975, he was awarded both the Eddington Medal and the Pius XI Gold Medal , and in 1976 the Dannie Heineman Prize , the Maxwell Medal and Prize and the Hughes Medal
[116] [117] He was appointed a professor with a chair in gravitational physics in 1977
[126] Following a conference in Moscow in October 1981, Hawking and Gary Gibbons [7] organised a three-week Nuffield Workshop in the summer of 1982 on "The Very Early Universe" at Cambridge University, a workshop that focused mainly on inflation theory
In 1981 at a Vatican conference, he presented work suggesting that there might be no boundary or beginning or ending to the universe
Hawking subsequently developed the research in collaboration with Jim Hartle , [7] and in 1983 they published a model, known as the Hartle￢ﾀﾓHawking state
Further work by Hawking in the area of arrows of time led to the 1985 publication of a paper theorising that if the no-boundary proposition were correct, then when the universe stopped expanding and eventually collapsed, time would run backwards
[140] Honours continued to be awarded: in 1981 he was awarded the American Franklin Medal , [141] and in the 1982 New Year Honours appointed a Commander of the Order of the British Empire (CBE)
[142] [143] [144] These awards did not significantly change Hawking's financial status, and motivated by the need to finance his children's education and home-expenses, he decided in 1982 to write a popular book about the universe that would be accessible to the general public
[147] [148] A first draft of the book, called A Brief History of Time , was completed in 1984
[151] The book was published in April 1988 in the US and in June in the UK, and it proved to be an extraordinary success, rising quickly to the top of best-seller lists in both countries and remaining there for months
[162] In the 1989 Birthday Honours , he was appointed a Companion of Honour (CH)
Hawking pursued his work in physics: in 1993 he co-edited a book on Euclidean quantum gravity with Gary Gibbons and published a collected edition of his own articles on black holes and the Big Bang
[166] In 1994, at Cambridge's Newton Institute , Hawking and Penrose delivered a series of six lectures that were published in 1996 as "The Nature of Space and Time"
[167] In 1997, he conceded a 1991 public scientific wager made with Kip Thorne and John Preskill of Caltech
A film version of A Brief History of Time , directed by Errol Morris and produced by Steven Spielberg , premiered in 1992
[173] A popular-level collection of essays, interviews, and talks titled Black Holes and Baby Universes and Other Essays was published in 1993, [174] and a six-part television series Stephen Hawking's Universe and a companion book appeared in 1997
Hawking continued his writings for a popular audience, publishing The Universe in a Nutshell in 2001, [177] and A Briefer History of Time , which he wrote in 2005 with Leonard Mlodinow to update his earlier works with the aim of making them accessible to a wider audience, and God Created the Integers , which appeared in 2006
[178] Along with Thomas Hertog at CERN and Jim Hartle, from 2006 on Hawking developed a theory of top-down cosmology , which says that the universe had not one unique initial state but many different ones, and therefore that it is inappropriate to formulate a theory that predicts the universe's current configuration from one particular initial state
[185] For practical reasons related to his disability, Hawking increasingly travelled by private jet, and by 2011 that had become his only mode of international travel
[186] Hawking with University of Oxford librarian Richard Ovenden (left) and naturalist David Attenborough (right) at the opening of the Weston Library , Oxford, in March 2015
[187] In a 2004 lecture in Dublin, he conceded his 1997 bet with Preskill, but described his own, somewhat controversial solution to the information paradox problem, involving the possibility that black holes have more than one topology
[188] [172] In the 2005 paper he published on the subject, he argued that the information paradox was explained by examining all the alternative histories of universes, with the information loss in those with black holes being cancelled out by those without such loss
[191] The particle was proposed to exist as part of the Higgs field theory by Peter Higgs in 1964
Hawking and Higgs engaged in a heated and public debate over the matter in 2002 and again in 2008, with Higgs criticising Hawking's work and complaining that Hawking's "celebrity status gives him instant credibility that others do not have
" [192] The particle was discovered in July 2012 at CERN following construction of the Large Hadron Collider
Hawking quickly conceded that he had lost his bet [193] [194] and said that Higgs should win the Nobel Prize for Physics , [195] which he did in 2013
[197] The book was followed by sequels in 2009, 2011, 2014 and 2016
[205] Appropriately, given Hawking's association with time, he unveiled the mechanical "Chronophage" (or time-eating) Corpus Clock at Corpus Christi College, Cambridge in September 2008
[2] [ bettersourceneeded ] As required by Cambridge University policy, Hawking retired as Lucasian Professor of Mathematics in 2009
On 28 June 2009, as a tongue-in-cheek test of his 1992 conjecture that travel into the past is effectively impossible, Hawking held a party open to all, complete with hors d'oeuvres and iced champagne, but publicised the party only after it was over so that only time-travellers would know to attend; as expected, nobody showed up to the party
[212] Hawking created Stephen Hawking: Expedition New Earth , a documentary on space colonisation, as a 2017 episode of Tomorrow's World
￢ﾀﾓ was posthumously published in the Journal of High Energy Physics on 27 April 2018
Hawking met his future wife, Jane Wilde , at a party in 1962
[220] The two were married on 14 July 1965 in their shared hometown of St Albans
The couple had three children: Robert, born May 1967, [221] [222] Lucy , born November 1970, [223] and Timothy, born April 1979
[225] Upon his appointment in 1974 to a year-long position at the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena, California , Jane proposed that a graduate or post-doctoral student live with them and help with his care
Hawking returned to Cambridge in 1975 to a new home and a new job, as reader
[180] [247] Reflecting on this happier period, a revised version of Jane's book, re-titled Travelling to Infinity: My Life with Stephen , appeared in 2007, [245] and was made into a film, The Theory of Everything , in 2014
[251] [252] The MND diagnosis came when Hawking was 21, in 1963
The earliest surviving example of these chairs was made by BEC Mobility and sold by Christie's in November 2018 for ￂﾣ296,750
Hawking used a variety of different chairs from that time, including a DragonMobility Dragon elevating powerchair from 2007, as shown in the April 2008 photo of Hawking attending NASA's 50th anniversary; [265] a Permobil C350 from 2014; and then a Permobil F3 from 2016
For his communication, Hawking initially raised his eyebrows to choose letters on a spelling card , [278] but in 1986 he received a computer program called the "Equalizer" from Walter Woltosz, CEO of Words Plus, who had developed an earlier version of the software to help his mother-in-law, who also had ALS and had lost her ability to speak and write
Hawking gradually lost the use of his hand, and in 2005 he began to control his communication device with movements of his cheek muscles, [287] [288] [289] with a rate of about one word per minute
In August 2012, Hawking narrated the "Enlightenment" segment of the 2012 Summer Paralympics opening ceremony in London
[314] [315] [316] A tribute was made to Hawking in the closing speech by IPC President Andrew Parsons at the closing ceremony of the 2018 Paralympic Winter Games in Pyeongchang , South Korea
Hawking's final broadcast interview, about the detection of gravitational waves resulting from the collision of two neutron stars , occurred in October 2017
, about the origin of the universe , was published in the Journal of High Energy Physics in May 2018
In 2010 he said, "If aliens visit us, the outcome would be much as when Columbus landed in America, which didn't turn out well for the Native Americans
He was later scheduled to appear as the keynote speaker at a 2017 Humanists UK conference
[366] [367] He recorded a tribute for the 2000 Democratic presidential candidate Al Gore , [368] called the 2003 invasion of Iraq a " war crime ", [367] [369] campaigned for nuclear disarmament , [366] [367] and supported stem cell research, [367] [370] universal health care , [371] and action to prevent climate change
" [380] In June 2017, Hawking endorsed the Labour Party in the 2017 UK general election , citing the Conservatives' proposed cuts to the NHS
Nimoy made the necessary contact, and Hawking played a holographic simulation of himself in an episode of Star Trek: The Next Generation in 1993
[387] [388] The same year, his synthesiser voice was recorded for the Pink Floyd song " Keep Talking ", [389] [174] and in 1999 for an appearance on The Simpsons
Hawking allowed the use of his copyrighted voice [394] [395] in the biographical 2014 film The Theory of Everything , in which he was portrayed by Eddie Redmayne in an Academy Award-winning role
[396] Hawking was featured at the Monty Python Live (Mostly) in 2014
Broadcast in March 2018 just a week or two before his death, Hawking was the voice of The Book Mark II on The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy radio series, and he was the guest of Neil deGrasse Tyson on StarTalk
Already early in the list, in 1974 he was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society (FRS)
Hawking received the 2015 BBVA Foundation Frontiers of Knowledge Award in Basic Sciences shared with Viatcheslav Mukhanov for discovering that the galaxies were formed from quantum fluctuations in the early Universe
At the 2016 Pride of Britain Awards , Hawking received the lifetime achievement award "for his contribution to science and British culture"
The Stephen Hawking Medal for Science Communication is an annual award initiated in 2016 to honour members of the arts community for contributions that help build awareness of science
The Starmus III Festival in 2016 was a tribute to Stephen Hawking and the book of all Starmus III lectures, "Beyond the Horizon", was also dedicated to him

" A public meeting is not scheduled before July 2010
What was said at the 2007 meeting raises questions about science and ethics that have suddenly become keenly relevant
But GlaxoSmithKline was sued in 2004 by Eliot Spitzer, who was New York&rsquo;s attorney general at the time, over the company&rsquo;s failure to publicize studies that helped to reveal that antidepressants could lead children and teenagers to engage in suicidal behavior
Em sua infￃﾢncia, quando ainda morava em St Albans , estudou na St Albans High School for Girls (garotos de atￃﾩ 10 anos eram educados em escolas para garotas) entre 1950 e 1953 - ele foi um bom aluno, mas nￃﾣo era considerado excepcional
Depois de abandonar o Instituto de Astronomia em 1973, Stephen entrou para o Departamento de Matemￃﾡtica Aplicada e Fￃﾭsica Teￃﾳrica tendo, entre 1979 e 2009, ano em que atingiu a idade limite para o cargo, ocupado o posto de professor lucasiano de Matemￃﾡtica, cￃﾡtedra que fora de Newton , tendo sido professor lucasiano emￃﾩrito da Universidade de Cambridge
No Natal de 1989, anunciou ￃﾠ famￃﾭlia que iria viver com uma das suas enfermeiras, separando-se em 1991
Casou depois com sua enfermeira Elaine Mason em 16 de setembro de 1995, da qual se divorciou em 2006
Em 1985 Hawking teve que submeter-se a uma traqueostomia apￃﾳs ter contraￃﾭdo pneumonia visitando o CERN na Suￃﾭￃﾧa e, desde entￃﾣo, utilizava um sintetizador de voz para se comunicar
Em 2005 Hawking usava os mￃﾺsculos da bochecha para controlar o sintetizador, e em 2009 jￃﾡ nￃﾣo podia mais controlar a cadeira de rodas elￃﾩtrica
Em 1993 participou em um episￃﾳdio da sￃﾩrie Star Trek: The Next Generation em uma cena em que ￃﾩ um holograma , conjuntamente com Newton e Einstein , jogando cartas com o personagem Data
No mesmo ano, Hawking leu um discurso durante a cerimￃﾴnia de abertura dos Jogos Paralￃﾭmpicos de Verￃﾣo de 2012 em Londres
Em 2012, Hawkings teve uma de suas falas sampleadas na canￃﾧￃﾣo "Entry of the Flame", presente no ￃﾡlbum Enlightenment: Music for the opening ceremony , que ￃﾩ o ￃﾡlbum oficial dos Jogos Paralￃﾭmpicos de Verￃﾣo de 2012 , que foram realizados em Londres
[ 57 ] [ 58 ] Os ￃﾺltimos cientistas naturais sepultados na Abadia de Westminster antes de Hawking foram em 1937 Ernest Rutherford e 1940 Joseph John Thomson
Obra [ editar | editar cￃﾳdigo-fonte ] O Presidente dos Estados Unidos , Barack Obama , fala com Stephen Hawking na Sala Azul da Casa Branca antes de uma cerimￃﾴnia de apresentaￃﾧￃﾣo em 12 de agosto de 2009
Em 1974 calculou que buracos negros deveriam, termicamente, criar ou emitir partￃﾭculas subatￃﾴmicas , conhecidas como radiaￃﾧￃﾣo Hawking , alￃﾩm disso, tambￃﾩm demonstrou a possￃﾭvel existￃﾪncia de miniburacos negros
Hawking tambￃﾩm participou dos primeiros desenvolvimentos da teoria da inflaￃﾧￃﾣo cￃﾳsmica no inￃﾭcio da dￃﾩcada de 1980 com outros fￃﾭsicos como Alan Guth , Andrei Linde e Paul Steinhardt , teoria que tinha como proposta a soluￃﾧￃﾣo dos principais problemas do modelo padrￃﾣo do Big Bang

They compromised on Natural Sciences and Stephen went up to Oxford at the young age of 17 in 1959
Stephen went to Trinity Hall, Cambridge in 1962
In fact, the two clashed in public in 1964 when Stephen interrupted Fred Hoyle, during a lecture, to tell the famous scientist he had got something wrong
Sciama also introduced Stephen to Roger Penrose in 1965 when Penrose gave a talk on singularity theorems in Cambridge
&rsquo; This thesis was released in 2017 on the University of Cambridge&rsquo;s website, causing the site to crash almost immediately due to the extraordinarily high demand
Supported and cared for by his wife, his loyal PhD students, friends, family, colleagues and his children, Stephen settled into day to day academic life, and continued working right up until his death in March 2018
In 1966 Stephen won the Adams Prize for his essay entitled, &lsquo;Singularities and the Geometry of Space-Time&rsquo;, and which formed the basis for his first academic book, co-authored with George Ellis, The Large Scale Structure of Space-Time
Since their first meeting in 1965, Stephen and Roger Penrose had many discussions about singularity theorems which culminated in their joint paper in 1970
Considered one of the greatest strikers of all time and one of the greatest players in the history of the Premier League , [4] [5] [6] Henry was runner-up for the Ballon d'Or in 2003 and FIFA World Player of the Year in 2004
Henry, along with Alan Shearer , was one of the inaugural inductees into the Premier League Hall of Fame in 2021
Henry made his professional debut with Monaco in 1994 before signing for defending Serie A champions Juventus
However, limited playing time, coupled with disagreements with the club's hierarchy, led to him signing for Premier League club Arsenal for ￂﾣ11million in 1999
Henry spent his final two seasons with Arsenal as club captain , leading them to the 2006 UEFA Champions League Final
Henry transferred to Barcelona in 2007 and in the 2008￢ﾀﾓ09 season , he was a key part of the club's historic treble when they won La Liga , the Copa del Rey , and the UEFA Champions League
In 2010, he joined Major League Soccer (MLS) club New York Red Bulls and returned to Arsenal on loan for two months in 2012, before retiring in 2014
Henry enjoyed sustained success with France , winning the 1998 FIFA World Cup , UEFA Euro 2000 and 2003 FIFA Confederations Cup
He was also named to the UEFA Euro 2000 Team of the Tournament , awarded both the 2003 FIFA Confederations Cup Golden Ball and Golden Shoe , and was named to the 2006 FIFA World Cup All-Star Team
After amassing 123 appearances and 51 goals, Henry retired from international football after the 2010 FIFA World Cup
In 2016, he was appointed as an assistant coach at Belgium , before assuming the role as the head coach at former club Monaco in 2018
He was relieved of his duties at Monaco in January 2019 and returned to MLS less than a year later to manage Montrￃﾩal Impact
He led Montrￃﾩal to the playoffs in the 2020 season before stepping down in 2021
[8] [13] By his third season, he had received his first cap for the national team , and was part of the winning team in the 1998 FIFA World Cup
Unsettled in Italy, Henry transferred from Juventus on 3 August 1999 to Arsenal for an estimated fee of ￂﾣ11million, reuniting with his former manager Arsￃﾨne Wenger
Coming off the back of a victorious UEFA Euro 2000 campaign with the national team, Henry was ready to make an impact in the 2000￢ﾀﾓ01 season
[2] [23] There was much expectation that Henry would replicate his club form for France during the 2002 FIFA World Cup , but the defending champions suffered a shock exit at the group stage
[26] [27] His rising status as one of the world's best footballers was affirmed when he emerged runner-up for the 2003 FIFA World Player of the Year award
[19] With 24 goals and 20 assists in the league, Henry set a new record for most assists in a single Premier League season, [28] and also became the first player in history to record at least 20 goals and 20 assists in a single season in one of Europe's top￢ﾀﾓfive leagues￢ﾀﾔthis feat has since been matched by Lionel Messi in 2020
[31] Apart from being named for the second year running as the PFA Players' Player of the Year and FWA Footballer of the Year , [26] [27] Henry emerged once again as the runner-up for 2004 FIFA World Player of the Year award
[2] [32] However, as was the case in 2002, Henry was unable to lead the national side to honours during UEFA Euro 2004
[32] The unexpected departure of Arsenal's captain Patrick Vieira in the 2005 close season led to Henry being awarded club captaincy, a role which many felt was not naturally suited for him; the captaincy is more commonly given to defenders or midfielders, who are better-placed on the pitch to read the game
Nevertheless, Arsenal failed to win the Premier League title again, but hopes of a trophy were revived when Arsenal reached the 2006 UEFA Champions League Final
He scored his first goal for his new club on 19 September 2007 in a 3￢ﾀﾓ0 Champions League group stage win over Lyon , [51] and he recorded his first hat-trick for Barￃﾧa in a Primera Divisiￃﾳn match against Levante ten days later
[55] He won the first trophy of his Barcelona career on 13 May 2009 when Barcelona defeated Athletic Bilbao in the Copa del Rey final
[23] Before the La Liga season ended, and with a year still left on his contract, club president Joan Laporta stated on 5 May 2010 that Henry "may go away in the summer transfer window if that's what he wants
" [59] After Henry returned from the 2010 World Cup , Barcelona confirmed that they had agreed to the sale of Henry to an unnamed club, with the player still to agree terms with the new club
In July 2010, Henry signed a multi-year contract with Major League Soccer (MLS) club New York Red Bulls for the 2010 season as its second designated player
The Red Bulls eventually topped the MLS Eastern Conference by one point over Columbus Crew [62] before losing 3￢ﾀﾓ2 on aggregate against San Jose Earthquakes in the quarter-finals of the 2010 MLS Cup Playoffs
[63] The next season , the Red Bulls were 10th overall in the league, [64] and bowed out in the Conference semi-finals of the 2011 MLS Cup Playoffs
After training with Arsenal during the MLS off-season, Henry re-signed for the club on a two-month loan deal on 6 January 2012
This was to provide cover for Gervinho and Marouane Chamakh , who were unavailable due to their participation in the 2012 Africa Cup of Nations
[66] Henry was given the number 12 jersey ￢ﾀﾓ his old Arsenal number 14 jersey, the same number he wore at Barcelona and New York, was unavailable, with Theo Walcott inheriting it following Henry's departure from the club in 2007
On 17 February 2012, Henry returned to Red Bulls to prepare for the 2012 season
[77] After working at Sky for over three years, Henry quit his position in July 2018 to focus on his career as a coach
Henry enjoyed a successful career with the France national team , winning the first of his 123 caps in June 1997, when his good form for Monaco was rewarded with a call-up to the Under-20 French national team , where he played in the 1997 FIFA World Youth Championship alongside future teammates William Gallas and David Trezeguet
The 20-year-old made his senior international debut on 11 October 1997 in a 2￢ﾀﾓ1 win against South Africa
[79] Jacquet was so impressed with Henry that he took him to the 1998 FIFA World Cup
Henry was a member of France's UEFA Euro 2000 squad , again scoring three goals in the tournament, including the equaliser against Portugal in the semi-final , and finishing as the country's top scorer
[85] [86] Henry playing for France against Italy during the 2006 FIFA World Cup Final
The 2002 FIFA World Cup featured a stunning early exit for both Henry and France as the defending champions were eliminated in the group stage after failing to score a goal in all three games
Henry returned to form for his country at the 2003 FIFA Confederations Cup
In UEFA Euro 2004 , Henry played in all of France's matches and scored two goals
[88] During the 2006 FIFA World Cup Henry remained as one of the automatic starters in the squad
[89] Henry was one of ten nominees for the Golden Ball award for Player of the Tournament, an award which was ultimately presented to his teammate, Zidane [90] and was named a starting striker on the 2006 FIFPro World XI team
Henry missed the opening game of France's short-lived UEFA Euro 2008 campaign, where they were eliminated in the group stages after being drawn in the same group as Italy, the Netherlands and Romania
The French team struggled during the 2010 FIFA World Cup qualifiers and finished second in their group behind Serbia
During the play-offs against the Republic of Ireland , Henry was involved in a controversy in the second leg of the game at the Stade de France on 18 November 2009
Henry did not feature in the starting line-up for France at the 2010 FIFA World Cup
[35] Ranking Henry the greatest player in Premier League history, in February 2020 FourFourTwo magazine stated, "No one assisted more in a season
￢ﾀﾝ [122] At the 2018 FIFA World Cup , Belgium reached the semi-final, but lost to Henry's home nation France 1￢ﾀﾓ0
Henry was reportedly offered the position of head coach by Bordeaux in August 2018
[140] He secured two wins in December, defeating Amiens in the league and Lorient in the Coupe de la Ligue , however, this was on the backdrop of three additional Ligue 1 defeats to close 2018 in the relegation zone
On 14 November 2019, Henry signed with Major League Soccer side Montreal Impact , signing a two-year deal until the end of the 2021 season, with an option to extend it by a year until the 2022 season
After leading Montreal to their first playoff berth in four seasons, on 25 February 2021, prior to the 2021 season, Henry stepped down as head coach of the renamed CF Montreal to be closer to his children in London
He had not been able to see them in the 2020 season due to travel restrictions during the COVID-19 pandemic , and with restrictions continuing into the 2021 season, he decided to end the separation
In May 2021, Henry rejoined the coaching staff of Belgium prior to the UEFA Euro 2020
He was runner-up for the 2003 and 2004 FIFA World Player of the Year awards; [19] in those two seasons, he also won back-to-back PFA Players' Player of the Year titles
The statue recreates Henry's fabled celebration where he slid to his knees after a goal against Spurs in 2002
In terms of goal-scoring awards, Henry was the European Golden Boot winner in 2004 and 2005 (sharing it with Villarreal 's Diego Forlￃﾡn in 2005)
He held the record for most goals in the competition for one club, until it was broken by Rooney in 2016, [155] and held the record for most goals by a foreign player in the competition until surpassed by Agￃﾼero in 2020
[50] In two other 2008 surveys, Henry emerged as the favourite Premier League player of all time among 32,000 people surveyed in the Barclays 2008 Global Fan Report

[9] The ceremony was held at Highclere Castle , and on 27 May 2005 the couple celebrated the birth of their first child, Tￃﾩa
[9] However, shortly after his transfer to Barcelona, it was announced that Henry and his wife would divorce; the decree nisi was granted in September 2007
[169] Their separation concluded in December 2008 when Henry paid Merry a divorce settlement close to her requested sum of ￂﾣ10million
[171] Having made regular trips to the NBA Finals in the past, he went to watch Parker and the San Antonio Spurs in the 2007 NBA Finals ; [172] and in the 2001 NBA Finals , he went to Philadelphia to help with French television coverage of the Finals as well as to watch Allen Iverson , whom he named as one of his favourite players

Tras cursar estudios secundarios, Hawking ingres&oacute; en el University College de Oxford, donde se licenci&oacute; en 1962 con los t&iacute;tulos de matem&aacute;tico y f&iacute;sico
En octubre de 1962 hab&iacute;a iniciado sus estudios de doctorado en el Trinity Hall de Cambridge
Solicit&oacute; trabajar con Fred Hoyle , pero el c&eacute;lebre astr&oacute;nomo ten&iacute;a demasiados pretendientes y la petici&oacute;n fue denegada; muchos a&ntilde;os despu&eacute;s, el propio Hawking ver&iacute;a el lado positivo: de haber sido aceptado, probablemente se hubiera visto obligado a defender la teor&iacute;a del estado estacionario de Hoyle, desacreditada tras el descubrimiento de la radiaci&oacute;n de fondo de microondas en 1965
Tras casi veinticinco a&ntilde;os de vida en com&uacute;n, en 1990 la pareja se separ&oacute; y el cient&iacute;fico se fue a vivir con Elaine Mason, una de las enfermeras que lo cuidaba y con la que cinco a&ntilde;os m&aacute;s tarde contrajo matrimonio; esta segunda relaci&oacute;n se prolongar&iacute;a hasta 2007
Despu&eacute;s de obtener el t&iacute;tulo de doctor en f&iacute;sica te&oacute;rica (1966), su pasi&oacute;n por el estudio del origen del universo fue en aumento, y sus investigaciones se centraron en el campo de la relatividad general, particularmente en la f&iacute;sica de los agujeros negros, descrita por primera vez por Robert Oppenheimer en 1939
En 1971 sugiri&oacute; la formaci&oacute;n, a continuaci&oacute;n del big bang, de numerosos objetos denominados &laquo;miniagujeros negros&raquo;, que contendr&iacute;an alrededor de mil millones de toneladas m&eacute;tricas de masa, pero ocupar&iacute;an s&oacute;lo el espacio de un prot&oacute;n, circunstancia que originar&iacute;a enormes campos gravitatorios, regidos por las leyes de la relatividad
En 1974 propuso, de acuerdo con las predicciones de la f&iacute;sica cu&aacute;ntica, que los agujeros negros emiten radiaci&oacute;n t&eacute;rmica hasta agotar su energ&iacute;a y extinguirse
En 1974 Hawking fue designado miembro de la Royal Society y, tres a&ntilde;os m&aacute;s tarde, profesor de f&iacute;sica gravitacional en Cambridge, donde se le otorg&oacute; la c&aacute;tedra Lucasiana de matem&aacute;ticas (1980), que hab&iacute;a sido dictada por tan egregias figuras como Isaac Newton y, m&aacute;s recientemente, Paul Dirac
Hawking continuar&iacute;a ocupando dicha c&aacute;tedra hasta su jubilaci&oacute;n en 2009
Primero la inmovilidad de sus extremidades lo llev&oacute; a depender de una silla de ruedas; despu&eacute;s la par&aacute;lisis se extendi&oacute; a casi todo su cuerpo; en 1985 contrajo una neumon&iacute;a que oblig&oacute; a los m&eacute;dicos a practicarle una traqueotom&iacute;a, tras lo cual perdi&oacute; completamente el habla

Dungy began his head coaching tenure in 1996 with the Buccaneers, a franchise regarded as one of the league's worst
He would be fired after the 2001 playoffs due to frequent postseason struggles, but is credited with constructing the team that won Super Bowl XXXVII the following year
He retired from coaching following the 2008 season
[2] Dungy was inducted to the Pro Football Hall of Fame in 2016
[3] After graduating from Parkside High School in 1973, Dungy played college football at the University of Minnesota , and was the Gophers' most valuable player at quarterback in 1975 and 1976
In 1982 , he was named defensive backfield coach, and was promoted in 1984 to defensive coordinator
Following a 5￢ﾀﾓ11 season in 1988 , Steelers owner Dan Rooney forced Noll to make changes to his coaching staff, which included demoting Dungy back to defensive backs coach
Dungy became an NFL head coach when he was hired by Rich McKay to reform the Tampa Bay Buccaneers, a team then well known for its lack of success, on January 22, 1996
In his first season at Indianapolis, the Colts were shut out 41￢ﾀﾓ0 by the New York Jets in a first-round playoff game , and the team lost postseason games to the New England Patriots in both 2003 (in the AFC championship game ) and 2004 (in the second round of the playoffs )
Dungy signed a three-year contract extension in October 2005 [15] for US$5 million per year
On January 21, 2008, Dungy announced that he would return at least for the 2008 season
Cam Cameron , former head coach of the Miami Dolphins , highly recommended the book by buying 1,000 books to give away to football coaches at his preseason coaching clinic in July 2007 in South Florida , [31] and said: It dispelled so many myths about the coaching business ￢ﾀﾓ that you had to be a yeller and a screamer to win
In March 2009 President Barack Obama invited Dungy to join the Advisory Council on Faith-Based and Neighborhood Partnerships
[38] [39] Their oldest son died by suicide at age 18, outside of Tampa in 2005
Louis Rams in the 2014 NFL Draft , Dungy said he would not have drafted Sam, saying, "Not because I don't believe Michael Sam should have a chance to play, but I wouldn't want to deal with all of it
Dungy's memoir , Quiet Strength: The Principles, Practices, and Priorities of a Winning Life , was released on July 10, 2007 [52] and reached No
1 on the hardcover nonfiction section of the New York Times Best Seller list on August 5, 2007 [53] and again on September 9, 2007
Dungy also published a 96-page paperback called Quiet Strength: Men's Bible Study on July 18, 2007
On August 3, 2010 Dungy released a new book entitled The Mentor Leader , which debuted at No

In addition, Dungy was a two-time Academic All&#x2013;Big Ten selection and also received the Big Ten Medal of Honor&#x2014;the conference&apos;s most notable distinction&#x2014;in 1977
After failing to get selected in the 1977 NFL draft, Dungy tried out for and made the Pittsburgh Steelers as a converted safety
Playing for legendary Steelers coach Chuck Noll, Dungy adapted well to the new position, even leading the team in interceptions during the franchise&apos;s Super Bowl&#x2013;winning 1978 season
Dungy&apos;s time with the Steelers ended after the 1988 season
However, despite making the Bucs a regular playoff contender, Dungy was fired after the 2001 season
Professional football player Joe Montana led the 49ers to victories in four Super Bowls, including consecutive wins in 1989 and 1990

His early life was the subject of an Oscar-winning performance by Eddie Redmayne in the 2014 filmￂﾠ The Theory of Everything
Arriving at the University of Cambridge in 1962 to begin his PhD, he was told that Fred Hoyle , his chosen supervisor, already had a full complement of students
But Hawking met his match at a 1972 physics summer school in the French ski resort of Les Houches, France
Hawking staked his position in another ground-breaking and even more contentious paper entitled Breakdown of predictability in gravitational collapse, published in Physical Review D in 1976
Hawkings 1976 argument that black holes lose information is a towering achievement, perhaps one of the most consequential discoveries on the theoretical side of physics since the subject was invented, says Raphael Bousso of the University of California, Berkeley
It wasnt until 2004 that he would change his mind
He seemed to play with his cultural status, says Hￃﾩlￃﾨne Mialet, an anthropologist from the University of California, Berkeley, who courted controversy in 2012 with the publication of her book Hawking Incorporated

Dungy￢ﾀﾙs career in coaching began in 1980 with the University of Minnesota before jumping back to the NFL with the Pittsburgh Steelers in 1981 where he rose to become the team￢ﾀﾙs defensive coordinator

Coaching Background: Defensive Backs Coach with University of Minnesota, 1980 Defensive Assistant with Pittsburgh Steelers, 1981 Defensive Back Coach with Pittsburgh Steelers, 1982-83 Defensive Coordinator with Pittsburgh Steelers, 1984-88 Defensive Backs Coach with Kansas City Chiefs, 1989-1991 Defensive Coordinator with Minnesota Vikings, 1992-95

[5] From 2006 to 2008, Forbes magazine ranked Livni on its List of 100 Most Powerful Women three years in row, [6] [7] [8] while Time included her in its 2007 "Time 100," for which U
From 2001 to 2009, Livni served in the cabinets of Ariel Sharon and Ehud Olmert , most notably as Israel's foreign minister , during which time she led multiple rounds of peace talks with the Palestinians
Consequently, she served as Leader of the Opposition from 2009, until her resignation from the Knesset in 2012
Later that year, Livni founded a new party, Hatnuah , [19] to compete in the 2013 elections, after which she was appointed Justice Minister in the Thirty-third government of Israel , again leading a new round of Israeli￢ﾀﾓPalestinian peace talks
In the 2015 election, Livni joined forces with Labor Party leader Isaac Herzog to create the Zionist Union , a unified bloc of their two parties
In January 2019 Avi Gabay announced that Labor would not run with Hatnuah in the April 2019 Israeli legislative election
During the 1984 Likud primaries, her father, who had served in the Knesset for Herut and Likud as a moderate, [19] did not campaign for a seat in the Knesset, and urged party members to support a Druze candidate instead because he thought it important for Likud to have Arab representation
[27] Livni began studying law at Bar-Ilan University in 1979, but suspended her law studies when she joined the Mossad in 1980
[28] She resigned from the Mossad in August 1984 to marry and finish her law studies
from Bar-Ilan University 's Faculty of Law in 1984
She practiced at a private firm for about ten years, specializing in commercial law , public law , and real estate law , before entering public life in 1996
Livni's father, Eitan Livni , a Herut member of Knesset, died in 1991
[34] Likud won 32 seats in the 1996 election , leaving her out, but newly elected Prime Minister Netanyahu appointed her as director general of the government-owned corporations authority, where she oversaw the privatization of a number of companies
[35] While in this capacity, in 1998 she was considered a prominent candidate to become director general of the Finance Ministry
Livni was first elected to the Knesset as a member of the Likud in 1999
Her first cabinet position as a Likud member was Minister of Regional Co-operation which she held from 7 March 2001 until 29 August 2001
In December 2002 Sharon appointed her to serve as Minister of Agriculture
She held this position until February 2003
She held this position until 2006
In 2004, Livni was appointed Minister of Housing and Construction , which she held this position until 2005
In the selection of candidates for the March 2006 Knesset election , Livni was awarded the number three position on Kadima's list of candidates, which effectively guaranteed her election to the Knesset
She held this position until 2009
After the March 2006 Knesset election , she was described as "the second most powerful politician in Israel"
[44] Forbes ranked her the 40th most powerful woman in the world in 2006, [45] 39th in 2007, [46] and 52nd in 2008
On 2 May 2007, Livni called for Olmert's resignation in the wake of the publication of the Winograd Commission 's interim report criticizing Olmert and Defense Minister Ehud Barak for their handling of the Second Lebanon War in 2006
2008￢ﾀﾓ2009: Candidate for Prime Minister [ edit ] Youth for Tzipi Livni party 2009
Facing multiple criminal investigations for corruption, Ehud Olmert announced his intention to resign his post as prime minister following a Kadima leadership election, which was held on 17 September 2008
In February 2009 Israel held elections for the Knesset
[69] During the 2009 general elections, Arab media depicted her very negatively but as the lesser of the evils
Following the 2009 elections in which Livni's Kadima won the most seats, but could not form a government, she took the party into opposition, becoming Israel's first female leader of the opposition
Prior to Lebanon's 2009 general elections (and its inclusion of Hezbollah ), Livni "acknowledged an important principle" from U
" She explained her position in a New York Times op-ed by alluding to her experience as Israel's justice minister when Hamas participated in Palestinian elections in 2006 : "At the time, the counterargument was that the very participation in elections would act as a moderating force on extremist groups
Livni voiced support for Israel's gay community ahead of Gay and Lesbian Pride Month in June 2009
As opposition leader, Livni noted in a 2009 Knesset speech that she herself did not support Yitzhak Rabin 's policies at the time
[84] Political analysts see Livni's speech at the 2003 commemoration rally for Rabin as a turning point in her political career when she became more popular among the Israeli peace camp
" As foreign minister, Livni would again attend the memorial for Rabin in 2009
[85] Livni attended the memorial for Rabin in 2009
[92] Livni declared that the 2009 Gaza military offensive had "restored Israel's deterrence
Judges in the United Kingdom can issue arrest warrants for war crimes suspects around the world under the Geneva Convention Act 1957 without any requirement to consult public prosecutors, which was something Miliband described as "unusual"
In 2011, private groups asked the UK Crown Prosecution Service to issue an arrest warrant against Livni under universal jurisdiction because of her alleged role in Israeli military action against Gaza in December 2008
In November 2011, the three candidates opposed to Tzipi Livni in 2008 called for a primary to be held as soon as possible, citing the probability of Knesset elections soon
On 19 January 2012, Livni set the primary date for 27 March 2012
Following the 2013 elections , in which Hatnua won six seats in the Knesset, Livni did not recommend any candidate for prime minister to President Peres
Secretary of State John Kerry and Middle East envoy Martin Indyk from July 2013 until April 2014
" [108] The process collapsed in April 2014 when internal political difficulties prevented Israel from releasing a promised fourth tranche of pre-Oslo prisoners and the Palestinians reacted by acceding to several international treaties
In December 2014 (after Livni had been dismissed as a cabinet minister), Secretary of State John Kerry told European Union ambassadors that his stance against a unilateral Palestinian measure at the UN Security Council was influenced by his talks with Livni and former president Shimon Peres, who said such a move could serve the political interests of those opposing the peace process
After the dissolution of the Knesset in December 2014, Labor leader Isaac Herzog and Livni announced a joint slate between Labor and Hatnua, called the Zionist Union , to contest the 2015 elections in an effort to keep Netanyahu, leader of the Likud Party, from securing a fourth term as prime minister
On 1 January 2019 at a televised Zionist Union party meeting, Labor leader Avi Gabay announced that Labor would not run with Hatnua in the April 2019 Israeli legislative election , surprising Livni
25% electoral threshold, and Livni announced her retirement from politics on 18 February 2019 as well as Hatnua's withdrawal from the election so as not to split the centre-left vote
Livni lauded Joe Biden 's victory over Donald Trump in the 2020 United States presidential election , stating that Biden is committed to democratic principles and that his election is "a blessing" for the United States, Israel, and the rest of the free world

After serving in the IDF, working for the Mossad, and practicing as a lawyer in her young adulthood, Livni entered the political arena in 1996 as a member of Likud
From 1996 to 2019, Livni served as a member of six consecutive Knessets
Knesset with the Herut and Likud parties from 1974 to 1984
Eitan and Sara￢ﾀﾙs marriage was the first official marriage ceremony in Israel after the state￢ﾀﾙs founding in May 1948
Livni worked for the Mossad from 1980 to 1984 before retiring from the agency and returning to Bar Ilan University to finish her law degree
Her time in the Mossad coincided with Operation Wrath of God, the Mossad￢ﾀﾙs retaliation for the 1971 Munich Massacre; while Livni has never confirmed that she was involved in the operation explicitly, there has been much speculation in Israeli society regarding whether or not she participated in missions related to this operation
She graduated from Bar Ilan University with an LLB in 1984 and spent the next decade working in commercial, public, and real estate law
In 1984, Livni married Naftali Spitzer, and they had two sons: Omri, born in 1987, and Yuval, born in 1990
Although she ranked too low on Likud￢ﾀﾙs list to become a member of the Knesset in the 1996 elections for the Fourteenth Knesset, Netanyahu appointed her in a special position as Director General of the Government Companies Authority
She held this position for three years, from 1996 to 1999
Livni became a member of the Knesset with Likud for the first time in the 1999 elections for the Fifteenth Knesset
The Fifteenth Knesset￢ﾀﾓwhich lasted from 1999 to 2003￢ﾀﾓencompassed a number of seismic convulsions in Israeli history, including the failure of the Camp David Summit in 2000, the beginning of the Second Intifada, Ehud Barak￢ﾀﾙs loss of the premiership to Ariel Sharon in 2001 in just the second special election for the office of the Prime Minister in Israel￢ﾀﾙs history, and Sharon￢ﾀﾙs subsequent convention of a national unity government
Livni remained a member of the Knesset with Likud following the 2003 elections for the Sixteenth Knesset, which ran from 2003 to 2006
Although Livni began her political career staunchly opposed to territorial concessions such as those outlined in the Oslo Accords in the mid-1990s, by 2005 she shifted to endorsing reasonable territorial concessions in the interest of keeping Israel a Jewish and democratic state
Livni joined Sharon in his new party, Kadima (￢ﾀﾜForward￢ﾀﾝ), in 2006
Kadima, now headed by Ehud Olmert, won the most seats in the 2006 elections and Livni continued as a member of the Knesset
While she was acting as Minister of Foreign Affairs, Time Magazine named Livni as one of the one hundred Most Influential People of 2007, and Forbes named her as one of the World￢ﾀﾙs Most Powerful Women for three consecutive years in 2006, 2007, and 2008
Olmert resigned as Prime Minister in July 2008 following his indictment on corruption and bribery charges, triggering party elections for Kadima￢ﾀﾙs new leader
However, she was not able to form a working majority coalition (citing a refusal to capitulate to the Sephardic-Mizrahi Orthodox party, SHAS), which led to the elections for the Eighteenth Knesset in 2009
Erekat, at an Iftar hosted by United States￢ﾀﾙ Secretary of State John Kerry, 2013
From 2009 to 2012, Livni served as the Head of the Opposition in the Knesset
She resigned from the Eighteenth Knesset in March 2012 following her ouster as the head of Kadima, after an internal party split along more conservative and more liberal lines led to a redistribution of delegates that caused Livni to lose the popular support of the party
She was elected as a member of the Knesset with Hatunah in the 2013 elections for the Nineteenth Knesset, during which Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu appointed her as Minister of Justice and chief negotiator with the Palestinian Authority
Zionist Union failed to overtake Netanyahu￢ﾀﾙs Likud in the 2015 elections for the Twentieth Knesset, and Livni again served as Head of the Opposition
Livni and her Hatunah party did not pass the electoral threshold in the 2019 elections for the Twenty-First Knesset
Following those elections, Livni announced her plan to retire from Israeli politics in February 2019

On June 5 and 6, the FDA will convene an advisory committee meeting on the diabetes drug Avandia, which was removed from the market in 2010 in most countries and placed under severe restrictions in the United States
In 2005 and 2006, GSK secretly conducted an analysis of the cardiovascular safety of Avandia and concluded that the drug increased the risk of heart attacks and related events by about 30%
Marciniak￢ﾀﾙs 2010 review of RECORD showed extraordinary bias in the conduct of the trial
If the RECORD trial was reliable, the logic goes, then the 2006 decision by CDER to conceal the risks of Avandia did not represent a dereliction of its public duty
Beyond that, the entire idea of reanalyzing a trial that began in 2003 is simply ludicrous
Marciniak￢ﾀﾙs 2010 review revealed such extraordinary irregularities in the trial conduct that no subsequent effort could possibly correct the flaws
Certain respected and independent members of 2010 Advisory Committee have been recused from the 2013 meeting
Keen observers should compare the roster of this new committee to the 2010 hearings to determine which participants have been re-invited and which have not

[254] [255] His prominent role in campaigning for President Obama during the 2012 presidential election and his widely publicized speech at the 2012 Democratic National Convention , where he officially nominated Obama and criticized Republican nominee Mitt Romney and Republican policies in detail, earned him the nickname "Explainer-in-Chief"

[277] To support her charge, Broaddrick notes that she told multiple witnesses in 1978 she had been raped by Clinton, something these witnesses also state in interviews to the press
[277] In a 1998 NBC interview wherein she detailed the alleged rape, Broaddrick said she had denied (under oath) being raped only to avoid testifying about the ordeal publicly
The Lewinsky scandal has had an enduring impact on Clinton's legacy, beyond his impeachment in 1998
[280] During the 2018 Congressional elections , The New York Times alleged that having no Democratic candidate for office asking Clinton to campaign with them was a change that attributed to the revised understanding of the Lewinsky scandal

During the 2008 Democratic presidential primary campaign , Clinton vigorously advocated on behalf of his wife, Hillary

(Agencies) Scarlett Johansson : This Hollywood actress was chosen as one of the top 10 most beautiful women alive on the Earth in 2007
It was established on 24 November 2005 by moderates from Likud largely following the implementation of Ariel Sharon 's unilateral disengagement plan in August 2005, [4] and was soon joined by like-minded Labor politicians
Although Kadima also won the most seats in the 2009 elections under Tzipi Livni 's leadership, it became an opposition party for the first time after a Likud-led government was formed
Livni was defeated in the 2012 leadership election , losing out to the more conservative Shaul Mofaz
In the 2013 elections , Kadima became the smallest party in the Knesset, winning only two seats and barely passing the electoral threshold
It did not contest the 2015 elections
The party was founded by Sharon after he formally left Likud on 21 November 2005 to establish a new party that would grant him the freedom to carry out the disengagement plan￢ﾀﾔremoving Israeli settlements from Palestinian territory and fixing Israel's borders with a prospective Palestinian state
[ citation needed ] However, on 24 November 2005 the party registered as Kadima
First, Sharon was hospitalized on 18 December 2005 after reportedly suffering a minor stroke
During his hospital stay, Sharon was also diagnosed with a minor hole in his heart and was scheduled to undergo a cardiac catheterization to fill the hole in his atrial septum on 5 January 2006
Yisrael Beiteinu joined the coalition in October 2006, but left again in January 2008 in protest at negotiations with the Palestinian Authority
Following her victory, Livni failed to form a coalition government, as she refused to agree to Shas' demands, resulting in early elections in February 2009
Livni lost the leadership of Kadima to Shaul Mofaz , considered the leader of the party's right wing, [15] [16] in a leadership election in March 2012
In the 2013 legislative election , Kadima lost almost 90% of its vote share from 2009
Prior to the 2015 elections Mofaz retired from politics after Kadima decided against joining the Zionist Union alliance
[23] Hasson had already left the Knesset in 2013 to become chairman of the Israel Antiquities Authority
On the domestic front, Sharon had shown a tendency to agree with his past political partner, the pro-secular and outspokenly anti-religious Shinui party (his allies in the 2003 government), which sought to promote a secular civil agenda as opposed to the strong influence of Israel's Orthodox and Haredi parties
In a 22 November 2005 press conference, Sharon also mentioned that he favored withdrawing from untenable Israeli settlements in the West Bank , although he declined to give an actual timeline or specifics for the proposed action
Following the 2009 elections , Kadima led the opposition in the Knesset
[37] [38] Shimon Peres told Ynet in 2006 that "there is no difference" between Kadima and Labor, and suggested that the two groups unite

William Jefferson "Bill" Clinton (born William Jefferson Blythe III on August 19, 1946), was the 42nd President of the United States, serving from 1993 to 2001
His wife, Hillary Rodham Clinton, junior United States Senator from the state of New York , where they both currently reside in Chappaqua, was a nearly-successful Democratic candidate for President during the 2008 primary season
His mother, born Virginia Dell Cassidy (1923￢ﾀﾓ1994), remarried in 1950 to Roger Clinton

) degree in 1968
While at Oxford he also participated in Vietnam War protests, including organizing an October 1969 Moratorium event
After Oxford, Clinton attended Yale Law School and obtained a Juris Doctor degree in 1973
They married in 1975 and their only child, Chelsea, was born in 1980
In 1978, Bill Clinton was first elected Governor of Arkansas, the youngest to be elected governor since 1938
His first two-year term was fraught with difficulties, including an unpopular motor vehicle tax and popular anger over the escape of Cuban prisoners (from the Mariel boatlift) detained in Fort Chaffee in 1980
In the 1980 election, Clinton was defeated in his bid for a second term by Republican challenger Frank D
There was some media speculation in 1987 that Clinton would enter the race for the 1988 Democratic presidential nomination after then-New York Governor Mario Cuomo declined to run and Democratic frontrunner Gary Hart bowed out due to revelations about marital infidelity
Often referred to as the "Boy Governor" at the time because of his youthful appearance, Clinton decided to remain as Arkansas Governor and postpone his presidential ambitions until 1992
Presenting himself as a moderate and a member of the New Democrat wing of the Democratic Party, he headed the moderate Democratic Leadership Council in 1990 and 1991
In spite of this, Clinton began his 1992 presidential quest on a sour note by finishing near the back of the pack in the Iowa caucus, which was largely uncontested due to the presence of favorite-son Senator Tom Harkin, the easy winner
Clinton used his new-found momentum to storm through the Southern primaries, including the big prizes of Florida and Texas , and build up a sizable delegate lead over his opponents in the race for the 1992 Democratic presidential nomination
A 1998 Mike Nichols film called Primary Colors , starring John Travolta and Emma Thompson, was loosely based on Bill Clinton's 1992 primary campaign
Clinton won the 1992 Presidential election (43
The 1992 Republican National Convention was perceived by some moderate voters to have been usurped by religious conservatives, and did not inspire them
Nonetheless, the "Don't Ask, Don't Tell" policy was agreed to by the nation's military leaders in 1993
Two months later, after two years of Democratic Party control under Clinton's leadership, the mid-term elections in 1994 proved disastrous for the Democrats
In foreign policy, Clinton hosted a White House Rose Garden ceremony in September 1993 with Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin and Palestinian National Authority Chairman Yasser Arafat on the occasion of the signing of the Oslo Peace Agreement
Clinton likely could have fostered more progress in Arab-Israeli peace in his first term if it were not for Rabin 's assassination in late 1995
Clinton also presided over the generally successful 1994 Agreed Framework between the U
In a lame duck session after the 1998 elections, the Republican-controlled House voted to impeach Clinton
With United Nations Security Council Resolution 1244, the bombing campaign ended on June 10, 1999
Lack of success in the Mideast was compensated by progress in the latter conflict, where his visit to Dublin in December 2000 helped revive the peace process
Under Clinton, the United States had a projected federal budget surplus for the first time since 1969
Initiated the Don't ask, don't tell policy toward gays in the military, 1993
The House held no serious impeachment hearings before the 1998 mid-term elections: Republican candidates rarely mentioned the issue of impeachment, but Democrats generally came out strongly against impeachment
The Republican leadership called a lame duck session in December 1998 to hold impeachment proceedings
The White House personnel file controversy of June 1996 arose around improper access to FBI security-clearance documents
The 1996 United States campaign finance controversy was an alleged effort by the People's Republic of China (PRC) to influence the domestic policies of the United States, prior to and during the Clinton administration and also involved the fund-raising practices of the administration itself
[15] Clinton's approval rating reached its highest point at 73 percent approval in the aftermath of the impeachment proceedings in 1998 and 1999
Widespread use of the Internet , especially the World Wide Web , began in 1993
" Until his inauguration, he had earned substantially less money than his wife, and had the smallest net worth of any president in modern history, according to My Life, Clinton's autobiography, released in June 2004
Nobel Prize -winning author Toni Morrison in 1998 called Clinton "the first Black president," saying "Clinton displays almost every trope of blackness: single-parent household, born poor, working-class, saxophone-playing, McDonald's -and-junk-food-loving boy from Arkansas," and, despite his career accomplishments, comparing Clinton's scrutinized sex life to the stereotyping and double standards that blacks typically endure
He assisted his wife, Hillary Clinton, in her campaigns for Senator from New York in 2000 and 2006, and in her bid for the Democratic presidential nomination in 2008
Clinton campaigned for a number of Democratic candidates for the Senate in the 2002 elections, but only one was voted into office
Clinton Presidential Center, in Little Rock, Arkansas on November 18, 2004
Further, Clinton twice visited the University of California, Los Angeles in 2006 to promote initiatives concerning the environment
He was transferred to Columbia Presbyterian Medical Center in New York City, where he underwent a successful quadruple coronary artery bypass surgery on September 6, 2004
After the official unveiling of his White House portrait in June 2004, the Asian Tsunami disaster, Hurricane Katrina, and the 2004 election, Clinton and Bush met, although the nature of the meetings did not appear to include a reconciliation of political opinions
Bush in January 2005

In the course of the 2008 Democratic presidential primary campaign, Clinton vigorously advocated on behalf of his wife, Senator Hillary Clinton, leading some observers and party members to question the appropriateness of his role in view of his status as a former president
" Following his wife's significant primary defeat in South Carolina , Clinton again made headlines when he appeared to undermine and racialize Obama's victory by comparing it to Jesse Jackson's failed 1984 bid for the Presidency
By the Democratic National Convention in late August, Bill Clinton delivered a powerful and rousing endorsement of Senator Obama as the formal party nominee for President, noting that charges of inexperience were leveled at him as well in his 1992 presidential campaign

Bill Clinton was the 42nd president of the United States, serving from 1993 to 2001
In 1978 Clinton became the youngest governor in the country when he was elected governor of Arkansas
president in 1992 and reelected in 1996, Clinton enacted legislation including the Family and Medical Leave Act and oversaw two terms of economic prosperity
Clinton was impeached by the House of Representatives in 1998 following the revelation of his affair with Monica Lewinsky but was acquitted by the Senate in 1999
Since leaving office, Clinton has worked with the Clinton Foundation and campaigned for his wife, Hillary Rodham Clinton , in the 2008 and 2016 presidential elections
Clinton&apos;s mother returned to Arkansas with her nursing degree in 1950
" The abuse stopped but the drinking continued, and the tension persisted at home even after Roger and Virginia&apos;s 1962 divorce and subsequent reconciliation
in 1970 to matriculate at Yale Law School
He served one term before he was defeated by the incumbent; he was voted again to the governorship in 1982 and served for four consecutive terms
At the time, Arkansas governors served only two-year terms, and at the conclusion of Clinton&apos;s term in 1980 a little-known Republican challenger named Frank White shockingly knocked him out of office
After spending some time working at the Arkansas law firm of Wright, Lindsey & Jennings in Little Rock, Clinton once again sought out the governorship in 1982
However, at the 1988 Democratic National Convention, Clinton squandered an opportunity to announce himself as an obvious future presidential candidate when he delivered an excruciatingly long and boring nomination speech for Michael Dukakis
In 1992 Clinton easily defeated his competitors in the Democratic primaries to become the party&apos;s nominee for the presidency, choosing Tennessee Senator Al Gore as his vice-presidential running mate
Bush , was vulnerable in the election of 1992 because he had broken his celebrated campaign promise not to raise taxes and, especially, because the national economy was mired in recession
The bill failed to move through Congress, however, and became a massive political disaster, leading to Republicans regaining control of both houses of Congress in 1994
In an impressive political comeback, President Clinton again embraced centrist policies and rhetoric to restore his popularity in advance of the 1996 election
Clinton&apos;s foreign policy achievements included presiding over the 1993 signing of the Oslo Accord between Israel and the Palestine Liberation Organization, during which the famous handshake between Yitzhak Rabin and Yasser Arafat occurred, stabilizing war-torn Bosnia through the Dayton Peace Accords and helping to end Serbia&apos;s ethnic cleansing of Albanians in Kosovo
In 1996 Clinton handily defeated Republican challenger Bob Dole to secure a second term in office
" However, Clinton told interviewers in June 2018 that he would not have responded to the situation any differently, and that he felt no need to apologize privately to his former intern
Clinton Foundation (founded in 1997 and later renamed the Clinton Foundation), he created the Clinton Climate Initiative, dedicated to supporting research to combat climate change; the Clinton Global Initiative, which connects entrepreneurs and world leaders to foster new ideas and action; and the Haiti Fund, dedicated to rebuilding Haiti in the aftermath of its devastating 2010 earthquake
Having published his first book, Between Hope and History , prior to the 1996 election, the former president in 2004 followed with a best-selling autobiography, My Life
Clinton played an active role in Hillary&apos;s failed 2008 presidential bid and, afterward, in Barack Obama &apos;s successful presidential campaign
Clinton showed his support for the Democratic 2012 election candidates , incumbents President Barack Obama and Vice President Joe Biden , at the 2012 Democratic National Convention
The former president has made other special appearances including administering the oath of office in 2014 to New York City mayor Bill de Blasio and eulogizing boxing legend Muhammad Ali in 2016
history, during which the Clinton Foundation came under attack as a "pay-for-play" service for the rich and powerful, Republican Donald Trump earned the majority of electoral votes and defeated Hillary on November 8, 2016
In 1971 Clinton met a bright young Wellesley College graduate named Hillary Rodham, who shared his political ambitions
The pair graduated from Yale in 1973 and married two years later in 1975
They had their only child, a daughter named Chelsea , in 1980
His second grandchild, Aidan Clinton Mezvinsky, was born on June 18, 2016, and his third grandchild, Jasper Clinton Mezvinsky, was born on July 22, 2019
During his 1992 presidential campaign, Clinton&#x2019;s doctors gave him a clean bill of health but said he needed to lose weight and that he suffered from mild hearing loss and chronic laryngitis
During his wife Hillary&#x2019;s 2016 presidential campaign, some media outlets questioned Clinton&#x2019;s physical and mental health
First elected to the presidency in 2008, he won a second term in 2012
' Following years of accusations, he was found guilty of sexual assault in 2018

Pela Seleￃﾧￃﾣo Francesa , Henry conquistou a Copa do Mundo FIFA de 1998 , a Euro 2000 e a Copa das Confederaￃﾧￃﾵes de 2003
Foi por duas vezes o segundo colocado na eleiￃﾧￃﾣo de Melhor Jogador do Mundo pela FIFA , em 2003 e 2004 , perdendo para Zinￃﾩdine Zidane e Ronaldinho Gaￃﾺcho , respectivamente
Subsequentemente, Henry assinou um contrato profissional com o Monaco, e sua estreia ocorreu em 1995
Apￃﾳs o tￃﾭtulo da Euro 2000 com a Franￃﾧa , sua segunda temporada pelos Gunners provou que Henry seria uma das maiores descobertas do clube
A partida do compatriota e atￃﾩ entￃﾣo capitￃﾣo da equipe Patrick Vieira durante a janela de transferￃﾪncias do verￃﾣo europeu de 2005 significou que Henry seria agora o novo capitￃﾣo
Finalizou a temporada com 12 gols em 27 jogos, sendo 10 pela Premier League , incluindo gols contra o campeￃﾣo Manchester United no dia 21 de janeiro de 2007
No dia 1 de dezembro de 2014 anunciou que nￃﾣo retornaria ￃﾠ equipe em 2015
Apￃﾳs dois anos como comentarista, em agosto de 2016 foi anunciado como auxiliar tￃﾩcnico da Seleￃﾧￃﾣo Belga
Apￃﾳs comandar o Montreal Impact, no dia 30 de maio de 2021 retornou ao cargo de auxiliar tￃﾩcnico da Bￃﾩlgica
Jacquet ficou tￃﾣo impressionado que o convocou para a Copa do Mundo FIFA de 1998 , onde Henry foi o artilheiro francￃﾪs na Copa com trￃﾪs gols
Cada vez mais ganhando espaￃﾧo na Seleￃﾧￃﾣo, em 2000 foi convocado para a Eurocopa realizada na Bￃﾩlgica e na Holanda
Dois anos depois, a Copa do Mundo FIFA de 2002 foi uma decepￃﾧￃﾣo para os franceses, visto que, apontados como um dos grandes favoritos apￃﾳs o tￃﾭtulo em 1998, foram eliminados ainda na fase de grupos do torneio sem marcar um gol sequer
Na Copa das Confederaￃﾧￃﾵes 2003 , sem os craques Zidane e Vieira , Henry teve grande participaￃﾧￃﾣo na conquista da Seleￃﾧￃﾣo Francesa, sendo eleito pelo Grupo de Estudo Tￃﾩcnico da FIFA o homem do jogo em trￃﾪs das cinco partidas
Na Euro 2004 , Henry jogou todos os jogos da Seleￃﾧￃﾣo Francesa
Henry foi um dos titulares da Seleￃﾧￃﾣo Francesa finalista da Copa do Mundo FIFA de 2006
Esteve tambￃﾩm na Euro 2008 , onde a Franￃﾧa teve uma fraca campanha, finalizando o torneio com um empate e duas derrotas
Um ano depois, durante as eliminatￃﾳrias para a Copa do Mundo de 2010 , envolveu-se no Incidente da "Mￃﾣo da Gￃﾡlia" , uma grande polￃﾪmica de sua carreira
Apesar de jogar como atacante desde as categorias de base do Monaco , Henry passou a desempenhar a funￃﾧￃﾣo de um ponta durante sua rￃﾡpida passagem pela Juventus , em 1999
Seu gol contra o Brasil nas quartas de final da Copa do Mundo FIFA de 2006 demonstrou isto; apￃﾳs um cruzamento de longa distￃﾢncia feito por Zinￃﾩdine Zidane , Henry saltou e apenas escorou de primeira no canto, numa bola que vinha em velocidade, tirando qualquer chance de defesa do goleiro Dida e demonstrando uma fantￃﾡstica precisￃﾣo
Foi vice em 2003 e 2004 no concurso Melhor jogador do mundo pela FIFA , perdendo para seu compatriota Zinￃﾩdine Zidane e Ronaldinho Gaￃﾺcho , respectivamente
No prￃﾪmio da FWA, Henry foi o ￃﾺnico a vencer por trￃﾪs vezes, em 2003, 2004 e 2006
Em termos de gols marcados, Henry venceu a Chuteira de Ouro da UEFA em 2004 e 2005, neste ￃﾺltimo ano dividindo o prￃﾪmio com Diego Forlￃﾡn , e foi o primeiro jogador na histￃﾳria a ganhar duas vezes seguidas o prￃﾪmio
[ 36 ] Alￃﾩm de Henry, foram lanￃﾧadas estￃﾡtuas do ex-jogador Tony Adams , que em toda sua carreira de 19 anos defendeu apenas o time londrino, e do treinador Herbert Chapman , que comandou a equipe entre 1925 e 1934
O casamento ocorreu em julho de 2003
Logo apￃﾳs sua transferￃﾪncia para o Barcelona o casal anunciou o divￃﾳrcio, que foi concedido em setembro de 2007
Henry tambￃﾩm ￃﾩ um membro do esquadrￃﾣo da FIFA para a UNICEF , onde, juntamente com outros jogadores profissionais, apareceu em comerciais de TV durante as Copas do Mundo de 2002 e 2006

Dungy was head coach of the Tampa Bay Buccaneers from 1996 to 2001, and head coach of the Indianapolis Colts from 2002 to 2008
[1] Dungy set a new NFL record for consecutive playoff appearances by a head coach In 2008 after securing his tenth straight playoff appearance with a win against the Jacksonville Jaguars
After the 2008 season , [4] Dungy announced his retirement as coach of the Indianapolis Colts, which went into effect after the 2008 2009 season
After playing quarterback in college for the University of Minnesota , Dungy went undrafted in 1976 and was signed as a free agent by the Pittsburgh Steelers of the National Football League as a defensive back
He played as a reserve and special teams player for the Steelers in 1977 and the Super Bowl champion 1978 season, leading the team in interceptions in the latter campaign
In 1979 Dungy was traded to the San Francisco 49ers , then finished his career a year later in the training camp of the New York Giants in 1980
Dungy was the emergency quarterback for the Pittsburgh Steelers in a 1977 game against the Houston Oilers when both Terry Bradshaw and Mike Kruczek went down with injuries on October 9, 1977
Following his NFL experience as a player, Dungy was invited to become an assistant coach for his alma mater, the University of Minnesota in 1980
He was hired as an assistant coach with the Steelers by Chuck Noll , his former coach, in 1981
In 1982 , he was named defensive backfield coach, and was promoted in 1984 to defensive coordinator
He left the Steelers in 1989 to become the defensive backs coach for the Kansas City Chiefs , and took over the defensive coordinator position for the Minnesota Vikings under Dennis Green in 1992
Dungy achieved his dream of being an NFL head coach when he was hired by Rich McKay to reform the Tampa Bay Buccaneers , a team well-known for its lack of success, on January 22, 1996
Despite finishing with a 6-10 record in 1996 , the Buccaneers finished strong and showed signs of developing into a winning team
In 1997 , the Buccaneers finished second in the NFC Central division, Tampa Bay's first winning season since 1982 after starting the season 5-0 matching the only time the Bucs were ever undefeated with as many wins in the 1979 season
Under Dungy's watch, the Buccaneers made four playoff appearances and won their division in 1999 only to lose to the St
Under Dungy, Tampa Bay struggled unsuccessfully to reach the playoffs in 1998
They went on to reach the playoffs again in 1999, 2000 and 2001
Dungy was fired on January 14, 2002 due to the club's repeated losses in the playoffs including two lopsided defeats (in 2000 and 2001) to the Philadelphia Eagles
In his first season at Indianapolis the Colts were shut out 410 by the New York Jets in a first-round playoff game, and the team lost postseason games to the New England Patriots in both 2003 (in the AFC championship game) and 2004 (in the second round of the playoffs)
The Colts focused on defensive improvements during the 2005 offseason, signing five-year defensive tackle Corey Simon
Widely expected to be a Super Bowl contender, the Colts won their first 13 games, prompting much speculation about the possibility of the Colts becoming the NFL's first team to finish the season undefeated since the 1972 Miami Dolphins
On January 21, 2008, Dungy announced that he would return at least for the 2008 season
He was the third black head coach to win a pro football championship in North America, behind Darren Arbet of the San Jose Sabercats ( Arena Football League ) who won ArenaBowl XVI in 2002 and Pinball Clemons of the Toronto Argonauts ( Canadian Football League ) who won the 92nd Grey Cup in 2004
Dungy will return for 2008 season
Billionaire Warren Buffett just turned 90￢ﾀﾔhere are 6 pieces of wisdom from the investing legend Published Mon, Aug 31 2020 12:39 PM EDT Emmie Martin @emmiemartin Share Share Article via Facebook Share Article via Twitter Share Article via LinkedIn Share Article via Email Warren Buffett
"Nobody buys a farm based on whether they think it&#x27;s going to rain next year," Buffett told CNBC&#x27;s " Squawk Box " in 2018
He purchased See&#x27;s Candies with longtime business partner Charlie Munger in 1972 and spentￂﾠ more than $1 billion on Coca-Cola ￂﾠstock in 1988 ￢ﾀﾔ both of which turned out to be good bets and both of which he still owns today
"Put together a portfolio of companies whose aggregate earnings march upward over the years, and so also will the portfolio&#x27;s market value," Buffett wroteￂﾠ in his 1996 letter to shareholders
"Though markets are generally rational, they occasionally do crazy things," he wrote in his 2018 letter to shareholders
Put simply:ￂﾠ"Don&#x27;t watch the market closely," asￂﾠ Buffett told CNBC in 2016 ￂﾠamid wild market fluctuations
You&#x27;ll move in that direction," he said duringￂﾠ a 2017 conversation with Bill Gates
Buffett married his longtime friendￂﾠ Astrid Menks ￂﾠin 2006, after his first wife of nearly three decades, Susan Buffett, passed away in 2004
As he said at theￂﾠ 2009 Berkshire Hathaway annual meeting : "Marry the right person
"Consistently buy an S&P 500 low-cost index fund," heￂﾠ told CNBC&#x27;s On The Money ￂﾠin 2017
"By far the best investment you can make is in yourself," Buffettￂﾠ told Yahoo Finance editor-in-chief Andy Serwer ￂﾠin 2019
" Honing that skill can increase your value by at least 50%, he said in a Facebook video posted in 2018
"Being given unconditional love is the greatest benefit you can ever get,"ￂﾠ Buffett told MBA students in a 2008 talk

Zeng was put under house arrest in August 2006 and the blog that details her life under constant surveillance and police harassment has been subsequently blocked in China
Born on July 27, 2008 in China, Zeng Jinyan started her career as Activist
" Youssou N￢ﾀﾙDour shows his allegiance to the genre without pretending to belong; his approach is different from that of African reggae's creators, Alpha Blondy from the Ivory Coast, the South African Lucky Dube, who was shot to death in 2007, or followers such as Tiken Jah Fakoli, who took refuge in Mali in 2003 to escape the violence of the civil war raging in the Ivory Coast
In 1992 he found an ally in filmmaker Spike Lee, who released the album Eyes Open on his label '40 Acres and A Mule' (named after the compensation awarded to freed slaves after the American Civil War)
In 1990 came one of his most beautiful albums, Set, which included the song Medina, an elegy that was pure and filled with nostalgia, and it featured a clear trumpet whose sound was almost Middle-Eastern
In 2003 he celebrated his becoming a Murid, following the spiritual path of Sufism, with the album Egypt, recorded in Cairo with an Egyptian orchestra conducted by Fati Salama
Super Etoile, with all its human variables, was uniquely solid: 1984 saw its Parisian debuts during Africa Fￃﾪte, the African cultural festival set up by Mamadou Kontￃﾩ from Mali, and it featured in the great pan-African dances and events organised at the Bercy Omnisports stadium in Paris by its leader
After meeting Peter Gabriel in 1984, Youssou N￢ﾀﾙDour joined "Band Aid for Ethiopia"; in 1988 he sang at Wembley when Nelson Mandela was freed, and then alongside Sting, Tracy Chapman and Bruce Springsteen for Amnesty International
This huge figure started in music in 1969 at thirteen with Bob Marley, playing with The Wailers during the master's time, and then with Peter Tosh or Sly & Robbie before settling in France to keep watch over the sounds of Tonton David and Tiken Jah Fakoly
By 1996 he was already famous worldwide thanks to 7 Seconds, his duet with Neneh Cherry (released in 1994 on the album Wommat, which also featured his cover of Bob Dylan's Chimes of Freedom), and he recorded Voices of the Heart of Africa with the great Yandￃﾩ Codou Sￃﾨne in the pure Senegalese Griot tradition
Still loyal, in 2007 he released Rokku Mi Rokka (the title is in the Pulaar language of the Toucouleurs) with musicians from the north, on the borders of Mauritania and the Sahel states of Mali
With brass, percussion, bass and guitar lines all from Jamaican sources ￢ﾀﾓ the album was recorded in the spring of 2009 at Kingston's Tuff Gong studios with Dean Fraser on saxophone, Michael Fletcher on "dancehall" bass and Earl ￢ﾀﾜChinna￢ﾀﾝ Smith on guitar ￢ﾀﾓ the album's instrumental add-ons are all wedded to Africa's memory and modernity, and its leitmotif is Youssou N￢ﾀﾙDour: from Bombay to Rio, and from Dakar to Melbourne, via New York and Bamako
